 * Location of the site configuration files.

 * directories used for configuration data. On install, the "sync" directory is
 * created. This is used for configuration imports. The "active" directory is
 * not created by default since the default storage for active configuration is
 * the database rather than the file system. (This can be changed. See "Active
 * configuration settings" below).
 *
 * The default location for the "sync" directory is inside a randomly-named
 * directory in the public files path. The setting below allows you to override
 * the "sync" location.
 *
 * If you use files for the "active" configuration, you can tell the
 * Configuration system where this directory is located by adding an entry with
 * array key CONFIG_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 *   $config_directories = array(
 *     CONFIG_SYNC_DIRECTORY => '/directory/outside/webroot',
 *   );
