The Vault of Artifacts
Artifact #1. My first artifact for showing my improvement is the reflection I did for interviewing Dr. <name> <name> It was to show the student learning objective of critical thinking, and quick decision making.
Dear Professor <name> ,
The audience in the sample I used was stated clear and in a manner that made it obvious who and what the content and audience were. The way that the sample was distributed and given was an uncommon way, yet while others had common ways of a medium, mine was uncommon. I do believe I accomplished the objective in all of its parts because I tried my best to go into deep detail about the audience and how it was explained.
Critical thinking was a major part of this whole experience. This project had many parts to it, where I had to host an interview, and write the questions myself. It is also difficult that not only did I expect some things to go wrong such as questions, I had to act quickly when everything went wrong. Before the interview I had done my fair share of research and I have tried many different tactics with connecting to Dr. <name> For instance I brought up that we were both from Tennessee and I thought putting a personal story into the interview to show that I did research and know what I am talking about. In my eyes, I do believe that I exceeded the expectations and I am happy with the result of this part of the essay. This is something I believe with all of me.
This was my first real paper of doing APA format so I did have some trouble doing the APA format and it was a challenge and this too took some critical thinking. I admit I had most of my help from the day we did the peer edit and review. I tried my best to absorb what we were doing and understand it but I think that this was one of the weaknesses I have in this project piece.
I tried strategies such as writing my questions on him personally and trying to connect with him on a level that I thought would be appropriate and professional. For my final project I did do lots of drafting and rewriting, revising, comments, peer edits, and more drafting. I have tried many, many tactics and I thought they would work because I wanted to be out of the box and courageous. In my opinion this way one where I was in between where I thought I did what I was supposed to and then some, but I also did do some out of the box ideas when they would work and pay off. I do believe I put all I could into this part and trying to be more out there and different. I believe I deserve these points.
This project was about growing as a whole and for me it was putting myself out there when I needed to be. I met all of my personal goals and then some. I didn't set any other writing goals than what I specified earlier on trying to be courageous and different. I put all that I had into revising and editing hours to make sure I tried my best on what I did and how well I did it. I am proud of my work I put into this project, and I believe I deserve these full points as well. I would like to ask for more help on my next run at this. I did do a peer edit but asking for your help would have been more helpful.
Thank you for the opportunity to learn and to push myself out of my comfort zone, I believe I learned from it. Sincerely, <name>
Artifact #2. The Flash community profile is a make up of many different point of views that include three different people. This artifact is to show how team work can truly help, not only is it teamwork but it is also it is a form of peer edit.
The Flash Community Profile
The Flash Television show which was developed by Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg, and Geoff Johns is based on the DC Comics character Barry Allen / Flash, a superhero with the power to move at superhuman speeds, fighting crime with his special abilities. The show has 6 seasons on the CW Network, spearheaded by the main actor Grant Gustin. This show takes place in the Arrowverse, which essentially means it takes place in the same time and place that the earlier show, Green Arrow, was placed in. The show has very strong reviews among the public, with an 89% like rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and has a very passionate fan-base. As we discovered through our research, many people are dedicated to this TV series, and are willing to share that. Through online reviews and personal interaction, we got to see first-hand how the community communicated, and the significance of it. To begin, we went out into the public and asked people of this community about their opinions on the show. They seemed to be a little taken aback that they were being approached in person. Of course they were all willing to speak, and also very passionate, but we could tell that people felt a little weird. These people were very attached to characters, doing deep into their knowledge and theories about the Flash. From the heroes, to the villains, to anyone stuck in between, the fans all had something to say, generally all positive too. They went on and on about the development of the story arc, and how it affected each character and the world surrounding them. An important observation was that people often tended to talk about the later seasons. We found this important because that showed dedication and commitment to the show. Many people would quit after the first or second season, but members of the community stuck with the show and watched it all the way through. Though the personal feedback was positive, it still seemed that other than conventions and other planned meetups, people tend to not speak too much about this in person unless it comes up in casual conversation. However, we found that the most influential medium these fans connect through is through the Internet. Our field notes were comprised of observations that I made by reading various websites that went more into depth about the show The Flash. There are a few main parts to the show that have made it as attractive as we are making it seem. It consists of family love, team building, and overcoming challenges everyone faces. Throughout all six seasons of The Flash the suits that Barry Allen has worn have been all have been different and in different ways, they provide hope and a fighting cause. The emblem on his chest means something to the people that he is protecting. The villains that are presented in each season also have the same effect to an extent. They make the team come together more and more, until they acted as one and unlike a group of individuals. The Flash shows how to overcome the odds that have been set time after time. Our notes reflect that and that is what got us to fall in love with the show. With open platforms to present all of their ideas and opinions, it is very easy to connect with like-minded people who are also very passionate about the show. Specifically with the internet, we see that when people see others with the same passion and the same opinions, there is an immediate attraction and a community is formed. This community transforms into a discourse community through further discussion of all of the different aspects of the show and sharing a common love of the show. In this case, the discourse community happens to be an extensive global fanbase. This discourse community formed naturally, because people generally like to express and share their opinions, thoughts, and feelings on such things like shows online to the public on social media such as twitter, instagram, snapchat, etc. along with websites and forums. All of these are then seen by many others who probably feel the same way, so there is a natural community that is formed, which over time creates a massive fanbase for the show. Through our research and personal experience, we have found that there is a stronger fanbase than expected. People from all around the world are willing to speak on their opinion of the show. They link up over something we all consider entertainment, and make lasting connections through something seemingly insignificant. On an even greater scale, not only just for this community, but anyone who is interested in anything superheroes can connect with others worldwide, discovering and sharing many ideas surrounding this universe that our ever-increasing technology has provided us access to. This community is a perfect example of how beneficial these relationships can be, just based off of the positive feedback and collaboration members get to experience.
Artifact #3. The one where I did not do my best and failed to demonstrate the SLO's.
Comic Book. (2019, January 19). 'The Flash': Barry Allen's Speedster Suits, Ranked. Retrieved from https://comicbook.com/dc/2019/01/15/the-flash-barry-allen-super-suits-ranked-the-cw/.
The Flasha s suits is the second reason I chose this show purely based on what it does for not only the super hero himself but also the team around him. The team is the suit and it has taken a little time to finally realize that but ita s what binds them. Family is important and this show highlights that more than any.
The Flash. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/The_Flash.
This course provides an insight into everything flash, from all of the villains he fought to any single detail in the show. The villains were one of the main reasons I chose this discourse community based on how much I liked the story line. I would use this website to research my discourse community if I didna t know what this show was about.
The Flash. (n.d.). Retrieved November 22, 2019, from https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/flash.
This site provided feedback from critics. It gives an average critic score and an average audience score, which is helpful for determining how receptive people are to the show. Additionally, Rotten Tomatoes gives feedback, series information, pictures, and important videos from the various episodes.
The Flash. (n.d.). Retrieved November 22, 2019, from https://www.facebook.com/CWThe Flash/.
Facebook is a great first-hand source for individual opinions. The open platform allows people to share their opinions easily and without fear of judgement or disagreement. The forum is a place with a multitude of ideas and reviews, so ita s perfect to hear the opinions of everyday people.
The Flash. (n.d.). Retrieved November 22, 2019, fromhttps://www.dccomics.com/characters/the-flash
This site is a great resource for basic general information on The Flash. It talks about how three different characters in the show redefined the word a heroa in different ways. It is a very wide platform where the whole fanbase of the show and even DC Comics in general can add information and read up on their favorite heroes and villains.
The Flash. (n.d.). Retrieved November 22, 2019, from. https://www.ign.com/tv/the-flash-cw
This site also details the show and its general plot completely. However, it also hosts many articles that have reviews on or detail specific parts and even episodes of the show. This is a great website to use because all different kinds of people can review the same show and it opens the mind up to many more perspectives.
The Flash was the discourse community of choice, because there is not only a very extensive fanbase, but there is also a lot to discuss regarding the show, its plot, and its characters. To begin, the group searched for general information on the show. Then, sources were carefully examined and chosen based on whether it was primary or secondary, its accuracy, and how deep it delved into the showa s plot and characters. It was important to consider all sorts of different perspectives while conducting our research, such as people disliking the show, any form of bias whether towards or away from the show, and indifference towards the show. The same patters existed in all of the chosen sources. They discussed the background of all of the characters, detailed each individual important character, and talked about what qualities make the show the big hit that it is. All in all, the purpose of profiling The Flash is to inform people who havena t watched the show about the important values it portrays and its modern relevance.
What made English 101 my favorite class. A reflective essay.
In the beginning of English 101 I came in not knowing if this class was going to be a conventional college class, with many papers and not really learning what I thought I would learn. Little did I know this class may have taught me more about myself as a writer than any other english class. In school I was always an unconventional learner, meaning I would a take the road less traveleda . In this learning style I was not always rewarded in this style, meaning it would take me longer to do the required assignments. Professor <name> made it possible for me to exploit these strengths, and prosper in these circumstances. The Student Learning Objectives (SLO) made it possible for me to hone my ideas for my writing and to take it to the next level. In my writing this year I did some reflection and I thought that I excelled in the critical thinking student learning objective. I also believe that I was working on learning how to identify the genres of all pieces of work. Almost daily in this english 101 class we had reading and it was talked about in class. While we did not have to write for all of these reading assignments, while reading I would try and use this student learning objective. While reading I would attempt to identify all of the audiences, and the genre that the author made it to be perceived as. I have always had a problem trying to find and consider the rhetorical devices and their knowledge. At the beginning of this semester I honestly could not wrap my mind around the idea of rhetorical devices and what it meant. Through this class I finally understood that the reason for these devices is to show how the author conveys their purpose and meaning for the artifact they are writing. It shows the true undermining of the authors purposes. I was telling this because I am proud of how I have learned to grow in this specific field of learning objectives. I have tried to incorporate this into my own writing whether it is a simple assignment or a large term paper. It makes it easy for the readers to understand what the purpose is. It is almost like navigating the reader to what you want to understand. Like I mentioned in the beginning, this is unlike any other english class I had taken, and in doing so I took a different approach to my own writing. In my previous classes, not only english, I have always been shy. This means I would sit in the back of class and not say much, must like how I do in this class, but I wasn't good about asking for help and taking criticism. On our second project we had to peer edit and this was when I started to come out of my comfort zone and ask for help. I shared my paper with three other of my fellow students and peers, and to my surprise I got some of the best feedback I had in awhile, and I genuinely think it made my paper even better than before. Another example of this is when in the first few weeks of school I had to talk to professor <name> about one of my papers. In this time I chose to open up and get to the true meaning of what I was trying to say all along. In the end peer and teacher edits made it easier to get feedback, and take my paper to the level that I thought it should be at. In the past some reasons I have always lost points is because of the lack of structure in my essays and papers. I was lazy in that sense and didn't put much effort into what the format was. I was always in the wrong font, not reading the directions and thinking it was all okay. I know it seems as if I had many mistakes in my writing and it is true I did, it was in this class that I learned to go above and beyond in trying to refine my writing skills and in the end I believe that is what I did. I worked on trying to be better and more aware. My first artifact I pulled out of the vault is my letter of reflection to Professor <name> about my interview of Dr. <name> <name> The reason I put this piece of evidence here was to show the problem solving I showed in the interview itself. One thing I did not mention in the reflection was how in the middle of the interview my audio recording cut out, and I was unable to get the most important of the interview. I had to depend on my shorthand in the absence of my recorder. I was done the the questions I prepared in the matter of ten minutes and I needed to come up with some more questions and quick. That is why I believe I excelled in problem solving in this situation. My second artifact I pulled out of the vault is the community profile my group and I did on the discourse community a The Flasha . This effort was made by a group, all of us did our part to make sure that the project was right where it needed to be. All of us did our part, for example, it was my job to analyze the artifacts of the flash community. It was also very helpful because I had my group peer edit my part of the paper, and while I had many mistakes it was nice to get some feedback to make sure I did all I could. In the year I have had in this class I have learned some lessons that I will take into all of the classes I have in the future. All of the student learning objectives have taught me a lot. I will continue to add more artifacts to my vault until I have mastered it. I loved my time in this class and I appreciate all that Professor <name> .
My Own Personal Blog
Blog #1:
In my head I have no fears, I am not afraid of meeting new people, or starting a whole new life here, or anything. Yet when I come face to face with those fears they all become very real. In the past I have had trouble confronting these fears and trying to make what in my head the truth but it's just not as simple as that. For instance when I was 12, I moved to <place> from Nashville, it was a whole new type of environment, and people. But I tried something new where I reached out to people and tried new things for instance to become more social, new sports and to make myself vulnerable. So I met my water polo team (sorry if these seem to be unnecessary stories, it's getting to a point I promise) but these guys became my brothers and from 7th grade to present day we were inseparable and nor did we want that to happen. We worked hard to be the best in the valley and we did by my senior year we had not only went undefeated all season but won the league championship, and in all of the excruciating practices and hell weeks we got bigger, better, faster, and stronger together as a family.
<picture>
So coming to the University of Arizona I am trying to do the same here, I believe I have found my group of guys that I want to be with and call my group because there is no other feeling for a human than feeling apart of a tribe or togetherness. As said before I am trying to learn from my past experiences both good and bad because while when we say things about our past we usually associate it the the bad so we can fix it, but what about the good? If we practice the good again and again then that's what we are going to be remembered for so that is my goal for here at the U of A to focus on the good and be thankful for that, including the friends I have made and am still hoping to make. So I look forward to what is to come while using my past as an example for the future. In my first blog I chose to incorporate analyze how genres shape reading and composing practices. To show this I gave a brief background to what I was thinking coming into this school year and why I was nervous. I also tried to make this for when the audience reads it that they can have a sense of how I was feeling at this time and why I chose to write about this, because this story is something I am passionate about.

Blog 2: I'm No Good at Goodbyes
<picture>
This week has had a lot of ups and downs, both in school and personally. In school I actually believe I have been thriving, I have been attentive and on top of all of my assignments and even turning some in early. The only downside about class is I am still getting used to the whole idea of not having bells to dismiss you or a concrete schedule for school, I mean I guess that is the whole idea behind college. Its to prepare you for the real world and show you that the real world isn't structured and perfectly fine like we think it is. The University of Arizona still does not feel like I am going to be living here for 7 more months, but instead an overnight camp where I will be leaving in 2 weeks. (Analysis SLO) I have to say that I am still learning about living on my own. I love every one here but I just miss back home so much. I miss my family and my sister. A quick story will show how I'm homesick and still trying to adjust and learning to the lifestyle here. When I was a freshman I used to live close to the <name> music festival, and artists used to stay in my neighborhood. That year it was Post Malone, me and my friends were freaking out and when we met him he wasn't as big as he is now but he was a nice guy, he took time out of his day to say happy birthday to me and a few other fans. So this week Post came out with a new album and it reminded me of this picture and that story. So I have been learning to cope with homesickness and to focus on my school work. I believe I have a lot going for me currently so the least I can do is work hard and prove I belong here. This blog was personal so I can stress how much I miss home and my friends very much. I was attempting to reach the audience's emotions and their sense of love for family and friends.

Blog 3 - The most wonderful time of the year
<picture>
This week is going to be different, tomorrow I start a new class, Intro to Archaeology and in a way I am very excited and ready for a new challenge. Since the last time I did a blog I have had two tests and had to manage my time so I can do well on them. Unfortunately I did not do as well on my exams as I wish I did. I attempted to study for my math and MIS exams but it did not go as planned. While some of these past events did not go as planned, I did have some other good things that happened to me and in my school life here. I joined an intramural soccer team and have been playing with guys that I enjoy and have started to become close friends with. In my essay for this class I was struggling with finding my argument to show people and for people to try and relate to. In the end I made my argument, and I guess it has been relevant even in these blogs, I was feeling that I need to engulf myself here, something that I have never done and needed to make sure I was comfortable doing so. The reason I tell you this is because I want to show that I am using the SLO of presenting my argument and defending it. My favorite sport of all time is basketball, this friday I got the chance to go to the opening Red/Blue game. It truly was amazing and I got to go with some good friends. It was a way to show that even though I am so hard from home I was able to find something that I love and enjoyed going to. The last SLO I was to emphasize is the overlying genre is change. As I have said before, I have good days and bad days here. This weekend was a good weekend, while I was feeling a little home sick when I was talking to my parents this weekend, I knew I would be seeing them soon. U of A has been treating me well so far and I am excited for what is to come. Basketball season is here, and that is a big help!

Blog 4: How Bradley Cooper has influenced writing
It has almost been seven weeks since we have been here and I am becoming more and more confident. A running theme in my blogs has been that I get homesick, I do think that it is normal but not for me. I usually dona t feel like this for too long. I have been trying to cope with this in new ways. My old teachers were very passionate about music and music in our lives. So when in romea . I have tried to listen to music that has more of a message than just the popular stuff that doesn't have much of a message. It may sound odd but I believe I have an old soul so I love to listen to old songs Mo Town preferably. My all time favorite song for this is actually a recent song. It comes from an Oscar winning movie, you may have heard of it, a A Star is Borna and the song is a Maybe it's timea . One of my favorite lines is a Nobody knows what awaits the deada and that is true, we don't know if what awaits is good, or bad, or both all we can do is live life to the fullest right now. I know this is a stretch to connect it to writing, but the lyrics are all poems, and masterpieces of writing, so that is what I hope to do, for english for all of my classes, business and what not. It may also be a stretch but music can inspire a type of writing, one that flows smoothly, and has more meaning behind it like the old music rather than the flat music that can be in this world today. If you were to look at the actual lyrics to this song, a Maybe it's timea then you would hear some of the rhetoric in the song. Most sane people listen to music so it is easy for people to relate to the idea of music means something special to that person. Also if you didn't pick it up by now I love love songs and they give a feeling unlike any other and to me that is one of my favorite feelings in the world.

P.S I apologize for the video but the song starts at 3:00, the scene is actually pretty funny but I understand if you want to skip HAHA.
Blog 5: Reconnecting with the family.
This past weekend was parents weekend and it was so good to see them! It was actually my mom's birthday and it was so good to spend it with her. It was also good to finally get out of the routine of all school and studying. I got to see my whole family and my best friend my sister. We all went to the football game and got to have some fun with my family. She also got to meet most of my friends, but also met a girl about her age so she got to bond with her and it was so good to see her having fun! Back to school, by this time I had just taken a test in MIS 112 and I did very well! It was such a good moral booster and got to be in a good place for this weekend to come. Preparing for this test I had to do some writing assignments and all of it was thanks to this class. It taught me all of the needs for making my writing successful, but it also made the process more smooth. In semester so far has already presented some challenges that I did not anticipate and I have to say I am not overly fond of them. I knew that coming into this year it will be difficult, but it was definitely a change and I was not entirely ready for it. I also had just gotten a job, and I am so excited so I can have some walking around money and be able to make my own decisions. I just hope that this does not become something where I need to devote more time to this than school. In my attempt to do the MIS 112 assignment I needed to revise and redo some of the assignment due to the fact of the student learning objective of revising. I have also tried to read and understand the readings of all my classes in ways that make it easy and understandable. I was so glad to see my family this weekend and am excited for the weeks to come.
Blog 6: Reaching out.
This past week in school I have lived and learned a lot. Not only in the classroom but personally, this past week I have been tested on and off for a week and it has taught me a lot. In the classroom math and english especially I have had to push myself to be a better student. In english I had to go out of my comfort zone and interview one of my professors. For me speaking to people gives my anxiety. Since coming to school I had a goal to try and put myself out there and be more outgoing and not the quiet person. I know that has been a topic of a lot of my journals but I have branched out to find more people like me and I have. Anyways back to school, this past english class has been testing but I also love it because of how out of the ordinary it is.
Math has also been the same, testing yes rewarding. We have a test coming up and it has been hard to prepare for it because a lot of the topics have been reviewed and trying to remember how to do the topics again and again. Tomorrow is the test, I have been trying to review and be the good and responsible student but it gets hard when the topics don't make much sense and hard to repeat them.
In english we had to use the audiences that our interviewee is using along with who we are trying to give our paper and audience too. I am trying to use this SLO in my paper and basically everyday life for school. Also with the first SLO, the second one I use is trying to identify genres and reading practices in works I use everyday. I use this SLO in not only english but my business classes, and math to an extent.
<picture>
I have started to find my way being open to new friendships and relationships. As old ones end and new ones start then it becomes easier to be a new person and transform myself into the person I want to be.
All in all school is being testy but rewarding, friendships come and go but I have found some new ones to stay.
Thank you.
Blog 7: Onto the next.
In the past week I did have to go outside of my comfort zone and speak in public. To me public speaking is terrifying and I am not comfortable at all doing it. Today in class was quite the experience because we had to talk to about 10 people explaining what our idea was. Some of the time it sounds dumb, my idea. It is something I know alot about and am happy to write about. In class I tried to put on a mask that made me look confident but inside I was nervous that the people would think my idea was dumb and wasnt good. To my contrary people actually did like it and were happy to add along to it, which gave me a confidence boost. Reading and writing have been more of the same. In my classes currently other than english we have not done a whole lot of reading. Every once in a while we have to read for an assignment or an important article for the class. If I am being completely honest I like having it that way, I am more of a visual learner anyway and I like being able to watch what I learn instead of having to read it and be responsible for retaining all of the information that way. One of the only ways that I do enjoy reading actually came this week. It is a letter from my buddies knowing what they are up to and seeing them do well. I miss my friends everyday and miss them but knowing that they are doing well makes it all that much better. In this I tried to use the SLO of connecting to the audience because if we are all being honest, not all of us love to read and that's ok! We all learn different ways and my way just happens to be by looking at what I am learning. In my last essay I didn't get a chance to say it but I was working on rhetorical devices and to my extent I was doing a good job of trying to be better and improve on my work to move to the next level.

Blog 8: The Beginning of the End
As the semester is on the downwards slope, classes are becoming more focused towards finals and strategies on how to do our best on them. This for me at least this is when the school work starts to get hectic and I start to slip. Classes have been about the same but just the thought of everything going on is starting to get hectic and hard. In my classes we have multiple essays coming and this is when all of the work I have been working on this year is english. My confidence in my abilities has definitely come wavered because of all of the grades I have been getting back, some are good and some give me the idea that I know I can do better. I have been trying to cope with this in different ways, I have been trying to work harder and smarter. I thought if I was able to sit down and study more then I would be more confident in the material but some of that have varied. I know this is only the first semester of freshman year but still it is uneasy knowing that I am not getting off to as good of a start I'd like. I really have been missing home recently because of how my old life was. School wasn't terrible but it was more manageable than it is now. My family is having a hard time adjusting to their life in San Diego. This time in my life is kind of hard because of all that is coming up.I know I am not a strong writer and just knowing that gives me worry. I am trying to balance it all out with exercise and being with my friends but it is still difficult to know what is to come. If there are somethings that I want to be known from this it is that I am admitting my weaknesses and I feel like if I point them out I can address them the way I need to. I just hope I can put everything I want to into the end of the semester so I can end with some kind of confidence. Once again I have turned to music as a way to escape and know school isn't everything.

Blog 9: Finishing Strong
Today has been up and down, I woke up at 5: 30 to choose my classes and get prepared for next semester. This was honestly one of the most stressful times of my semester. At first I was able to get on and select my classes but it took fifteen minutes before I was able to enroll and get all of my classes aligned. It was difficult to see that some of the people that I was signing up were getting the classes I wanted. It was also frustrating when I was trying to sign up for my math class and my pre-requisites have not been transferred and take up for consideration.
As the semester is coming to a close I have been trying to calculate the grades I have and I have been getting good news and bad news. After a long time calculating I finally came to the conclusion I needed and wanted. I was able to see that some of the grades I have are what I expected and what I like but in the same breath some of the grades I see I need to work harder and grind the rest of the semester to get to where I need to be.
I have been doing alot of thinking and in all of my blogs I have been using the same SLOa s but now in trying to do better I want to use new ones. This one I believe I have been using the whole time I just havena t but two and two together. I use evidence in visuals and quotations. In every blog I have had a visual. Another is making your argument evidence based, I have been trying to do that by explaining my side of the story and arguments.
I know a lot is going on right now with school, family, and breaks. There are only a few things on my mind right now. I am trying to finish my strongest in the field. I miss my family and can not wait to see them soon. I cant wait to see the country roads, soa a . COUNTRY ROADS, TAKE ME HOME, TO THE PLACE, I BELONGGGGG.

Blog 10: The Final Stretch
In the closing week of this semester I have reflected on what has made me succeed and made me have some trouble. In english 101, especially, it made me not only look and see what I was doing in this class but also in my other classes that made writing a requirement. Management of Information Systems (MIS) made some writing a requirement such as projects, papers and more. There were some points in the class this semester that made it known what my strengths and weaknesses are. Some I have found include re-reading my essays, reading all of the requirements, and finally taking time to know what I am doing. English 101 has taught me more about my writing more than any other course. Some of the things that have frustrated me in are when I have assignments that I did and turned in only to get them back and see that I missed the little things. That was the moment of let down that I knew that it was on me and I would try to do better the next time. On the upside, some of the things I will always remember about this course is that I got to do a report about my favorite show of all time. It was an unconventional project than we had in high school, and that is what made it so fun and entertaining. Something else I enjoyed about this course was the blogs, like this one right here. It gave me more of an insight of what I was really feeling. It was nice to just stop and think for a minute and just write. In a way it was how the genre played into this kind of writing, it is both non-fiction and reflection. It gives a new purpose to how I like to write and how it feels when I like writing. My ability to be able to think critically also made it able to say what was on my mind when I couldn't actually figure out how to say it. English 101 has been my favorite english class and it has proven to me that I am a good writer and I will take these lessons on. And remember were going home!
