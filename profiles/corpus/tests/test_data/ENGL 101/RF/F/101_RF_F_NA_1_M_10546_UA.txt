About the Author
Hi, I'm <name>. I'm a freshman at the University of Arizona and I'm a Physiology Major and Piano Performance Minor. I love to write, whether it be casually or formally, as I feel it is a great way to keep myself accountable and reflect on your past. Thank you for viewing my e Portfolio, and without any further ado, this has been my mental trek through this past semester.

GLANCING BACK AT A NEW MENTAL EXPEDITION: A STORY OF REFLECTION
Well, here we are. The end of the first semester of college. What a journey it has been, physically, mentally, and spiritually. Everyone had told me that college is an experience like no other, and I did not realize how true it was in so many different ways until I experienced it myself. It is truly the best time of my life, but at the same time it was pretty easy for me to find out that it is also the hardest. This has led me to experience growth in many different ways, both from simply learning about things that I had not learned in the past and from making mistakes and reflecting on them. One clear area that I have experienced a lot of personal growth is in my English 101 class with Professor <name>. It has expanded my learning and experience in both writing and critical thinking over just this one semester, and has provided me with many valuable takeaways that I can apply to my life in general. It has most of all taught me the importance of reflection and how it can completely change the way you act and think. It has given me the ability to clearly organize all of my thoughts and further be able to articulate those ideas, providing me with the ability to excel in the future.
Back in middle school and high school, I was required to do a lot of writing. Believe me, it was A LOT of writing. We were required to read deep and philosophical texts, sometimes even just normal novels, but then be able to write a philosophical paper on an aspect of the text of our choosing that exemplifies our critical thinking. They all needed to have a certain structure, have a thesis and topic sentences, and use MLA formatting. We were also required to write a 15-20 page senior thesis, which we used two books for, one from our high school curriculum and one of our choosing from outside of school, and wrote a philosophical paper exploring any of the six great ideas: Truth, Goodness, Beauty, Liberty, Equality, and Justice. As you can see, all the papers I have ever written are philosophical papers that require you to think critically and outside the box. When I first stepped into Professor <name> English 101 class, I had no idea what to expect. I thought it would be a fairly easy, straightforward class on everything I already knew. However, it was nothing like I expected. It was very interactive class, and still required me to think very critically about everything.
I had never written or even tried to write anything like the projects we were going to do this semester . I looked at the syllabus and nothing seemed familiar to me. However, as the class progressed, I learned different methods of writing and different ways to think. I am now able to clearly identify the purpose, intended audience, and arguments of any text and then implement such strategies in my own writing using my new rhetorical knowledge (SLOs 1a, 1b, 1d). This can be clearly seen in my Literacy Narrative Project (see Project 1), where I directly target a specific audience with a specific purpose and argument in mind in the third and fourth paragraphs (see Artifact 1). I talk about my struggle with playing the piano and how I overcame it, so when people who are struggling in something see it, it can give them hope and inspiration. There are other categories in which I have improved.
I have also learned the difference between primary and secondary research and sources, and can now properly cite them, evaluate their credibility, and use them as evidence to develop a sound and persuasive argument (SLOs 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 2f, 4e). This can be clearly seen in the Annotated Bibliography that my group and I created and revised (see Artifact 2). For our annotated bibliography, we found primary and credible sources that contain valid and unbiased information regarding our topic for our Community Profile (see Project 3), which was the TV show The Flash and its extensive fanbase. We then proceeded to incorporate the evidence in the sources to support our argument and put forth a compelling discussion from multiple of those sources. However, our group could have also used better formatting for the Annotated Bibliography, as we did not properly cite the sources in the APA format. From this experience, I now know how to properly conduct correct research and use the results in the right manner. However, there are still more important areas where I have shown great improvement.
Along with all of these things came the essential elements of revision and reflection, which I had not implemented very much before. These methods of revision and reflection have not only given me a different and clearer way to think and write, but have improved my writing and even my life in general quite a bit. I have learned to revise projects multiple times both globally and locally, help and be helped by others in revising and reflecting on projects, and reflect very well on my own projects (SLOs 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f). This is very evident in my own self-evaluations on my projects, specifically the one for my Community Profile (see Artifact 3). In the self-evaluation, I talk about how our group collaboratively set out to gather research and then proceeded to congregate and work together on the Community Profile on a Google Doc. I show how we actively give each other feedback and suggestions while we are working, and I explain how we made many revisions and many drafts of the project before submitting the final version to D2L. In all of this, this artifact in itself is a reflection, and I have learned how to carefully reflect on things I have done, considering everything in the situation how I did what I did in order to see what I did well and where I can improve for the next time. It is a very useful and valuable tool I will use for the rest of my life. These are all areas where I have shown considerable growth and improvement.
All of the above artifacts demonstrate how I showed growth in certain SLOs through projects and assignments I did well on. However, I have also struggled with certain SLOs, and that can be demonstrated by the third paragraph of my Genre Discourse Analysis (see Artifact 4). While working toward the final Genre Discourse Analysis draft, I had to conduct an interview of someone in my future field, so I chose my Honors Chemistry professor, and the interview went very well. However, when the time came to write my final paper, I focused too much on the interview itself rather than the document I was analyzing, and I did not go deep enough into the description of the audience or the purpose. I needed to talk more about how the document affected the targeted audience instead of focusing on the interview. Although I have a decent hold on them, this shows that there is still room for me to grow in SLOs 1a, 1b, and 1c. As you can see, along with all the progress I have made, there are still clear areas where more growth and improvement are necessary.
When you combine all of these things, it is apparent that this class has had a huge effect on my life. All of the activities and projects in this class have given me many valuable tools and skills that I will continue to improve and expand on. My writing and critical thinking capacities have evolved over the course of the past four months, and what I am taking away from this class has truly enhanced my writing and thinking capabilities. I have learned things I never thought I would through English 101 and its first semester experiences that I will continue to implement in my life for a very long time. I loved my professor and I loved the class, and I hope I can have a similar experience in English 102 next semester so I can show growth in all of the SLOs and show development in the areas I need it in while working on next semester's English projects. There is always room for improvement, and I hope I can continue to reflect and improve in all of these categories in the future.

BLOGS
Blog 1: My Initial Thoughts and Feelings
First of all, I would like to say that I am very excited for this class. I am excited to get to know and get closer with all of my classmates as well as Dr <name>, because they all seem like very interesting and fun personalities. I am excited to wake up every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning and go to Dr. <name> class, because I know the class is always going to be lively and entertaining. She seems like a really kind and relatable professor with an upbeat and positive personality, and it only makes it better that we are a small class, so she can get to know each one of us really well. We started in class by doing some icebreakers and going over the syllabus, which is usually somewhat boring, but to be honest, even that was pretty fun. I got to know some of my classmates a little better and I think they are all going to be great friends to have. I also now know what is expected of me in this class. I had a class called Humane Letters at my high school <name> <name> a Great Hearts Academy. It was a very rigorous class for two hours a day where we would read philosophical texts for homework and have a daily Socratic discussion on them in class. I have had to write many critical thinking essays for that class and I have managed to do pretty well. I have also had to write and defend a 15-20 page senior thesis last year, for which I received a pass with distinction. Therefore, I think and hope that I will be able to write well in this class. This semester, I want to learn how to paraphrase and summarize better and more concise (SLO 2A) as well as make sure my logical flow is intact and makes good sense to the reader. Also, since we are a small class and I think we will all get very close, I want to try and have my work revised by a bunch of other classmates as well as revise other peoples' papers. We also talked a great deal about reflection in class on Friday, and I agree that it is absolutely essential to becoming a better thinker and writer. I want to incorporate reflection more into not just my writing, but my life. All in all, I think this is going to be a wonderful class, and I can't wait for what's to come!
Blog 2: Getting Used to Things
We are now two weeks into school at the University of Arizona, and overall, I have to say they have been two of the best weeks of my life. I'm starting to settle into everything, the Honors Village, my classes, meals, hanging with friends, social events, clubs, research, everything is going great. It's a great feeling waking up at 7: 30 on a Monday morning after an extremely fun-packed weekend knowing that my first class is English 101 with Professor <name>. I know I can look forward to a fun and stress-less class that truly enjoy and learn both academic and life lessons in. It has only been two weeks, and I have already learned so much from this class. Our class has already gotten a lot closer, and it is so easy for us to talk to each other about whatever. I have made a bunch of new friends all around me, and they are so kind and so easy to start a conversation with. Through the in-class group activities and talks I have gotten to know a lot of them much better and we have all been able to share knowledge as well as memories, hobbies, interests, cool facts, and other personal information with each other. This makes me very excited for the rest of the semester, because I love group work and activities, and I know we will have a lot more in the future. We have talked about how to create a personal blog, like the one you are reading, for the purpose of writing about the English 101 class, and it was pretty easy for me to create. I am obviously using Adobe Spark, and it was very easy to set up and it is very easy to type and publish whatever I want. We also talked about stories versus narratives, and we listed things about ourselves that we could use in them. There are big differences between the two, and it is very important for us to be able to differentiate between them. I have completely understood all of the stuff that we have talked about. My goals will be to produce good drafts of our upcoming literacy narrative project so i have enough time to proofread and perfect it to the best of my abilities (SLO 4b), and get other people, whether it be peers or instructors, or to read my work and give me feedback and suggestions.

Blog 3: My First English 101 Project
We are now four weeks into school at the University of Arizona, and in my opinion it is going fantastic. I am thoroughly enjoying my classes and interacting with my peers and professors, and I would not rather be anywhere else but here. I am very comfortable with my schedule, and I know the campus like the back of my hand. Waking up in the morning and going to class has actually been a very enjoyable experience, especially in Professor <name> English 101 class. I'm still getting excited every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings to go to her class and not only improve my writing, but improve my interpersonal skills and learn valuable techniques for how to communicate in different circumstances. In addition, she also makes the class very fun and upbeat, so everyone is always paying attention and involved in all of the activities. I have gotten very close to some of my peers, and we have become great friends even in just a few weeks, and we are all very comfortable in the class. More group in-class activities have sparked more personal growth in me and helped me get very close with not just a few people, but everyone in the class. I am constantly learning in English, because there are always ways to improve in the subject area. I cannot wait to see where this class goes from here, because it has been so interesting and enjoyable thus far, and I expect it can only get better. Last week, I completed and submitted my first project in the class, which was the Literacy Narrative. I chose to write on my musical background and literacy, because it is so naturally interwoven into human beings and it is a universal language. I have also had struggles in my musical journey, so it was a great topic to help others relate to as well. I began by identifying what I was actually writing, its purpose, the audiences, and the arguments I would use, jotting down ideas for what to write on (SLO 1A). I then organized all of those ideas and information into a proper outline. I used real evidence from when I was struggling in music in late middle school in order to relate with others on a more personal level (SLO 2A). I then wrote a full rough draft of the literacy narrative to review with and get feedback from Professor <name> on. She was very helpful, and taught me some very valuable things that I will make sure to use in all of my writing from now on. Professor <name> reviewing my paper with me was essential to the project, as I never would have thought of some of her advice and suggestions myself (SLO 4D). I then turned in a complete final draft of my literacy narrative after making proper modifications to my draft, and it turned out really well. This is also partially because I made multiple drafts and versions of the paper to revise and refine my writing (SLO 4B). Overall, I really enjoyed the project, and it was great writing in a convention that I have never written in before. We have just started our second project, the Interview, and hopefully I do well on that as well!
Blog 4: Transition Into My Interview
We are now six weeks into school at the University of Arizona, and it is still going amazing overall. Classes are clearly getting much harder, and there is a lot more pressure now than there was at the beginning of the school year. It is getting very difficult to balance and manage everything with classes, clubs, and extracurriculars such as piano and tennis, so i have had to make some sacrifices and organize better so that I know exactly what is going on at all times. This allows me to be more productive, and I am still somehow managing to pass all of my classes. I did not do this in high school at all, because it was easier to manage everything because it was all in one place anyway. However, here in college, everything is scattered, and it is completely the students' responsibility to keep track of all of their things, whether it be events, classes, homework, clubs, or extracurriculars. I have become more efficient and am managing my life better. We interviewed <name> <name> in class last Wednesday to prepare for our own individual interviews to follow to have a set of guidelines of what questions to ask and how to record them. We talked about more writing techniques and strategies used to be more effective with words and visuals (SLO 4A). I conducted my interview with Dr. <name> <name> at his office hours today, Monday, and I asked him the questions I had initially written down on my outline. I recorded the interview on Voice Memos on my laptop, and I would say the interview went very well. Not only did i gather information about what we needed for English 101, but I got closer to an awesome professor and learned more about him as well as a little bit on what direction I want to go in the future. I further revised my notes during the interview to a proper organized format that I can move forward with (SLO 4B). Now I have to write an interview summary report based on all of the information I got today and turn it in on Friday. This is a very new experience to me, and I have not done anything remotely like this before. However, I love getting out of my comfort zone and experiencing new things, so it was an awesome project to conduct and I thoroughly enjoyed it. As you can probably tell, I am absolutely loving Professor <name> class, and it is by far one of my favorite classes I have had in a long time. I am definitely looking forward to more new experiences and fun projects in the near future!
Blog 5: The Interview and Analysis
We are now seven weeks into school at the University of Arizona, and although I am loving the experience of college and all it has to offer, this week in particular has been one of the most demanding and challenging of my life. I had a lot of homework and many deadlines, multiple tests, a piano performance, and club meetings along with my other daily activities and necessities, which made this last week almost impossible to deal with. I had many sleepless nights where I would either just be working or staring at the ceiling not being able to sleep due to too much stress and pressure. However, I somehow managed to make it through the week and not only submit everything on time, but get good grades on all of them, and I am now doing well in all of my classes, although it is still stressful. At least I could look forward to coming to Professor <name> class every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning, because it always seems to ease my stress and let me forget about all the impending work I have. It lets me live in the moment, have fun, and enjoy my education. The way that she conducts the class and the fact that we do so many group activities and discussions makes the class so fun and enjoyable and at the same time very educational. I have learned a lot from her class over the past seven weeks that I did not know before, and I am happy to say that it is one of the best classes I have ever taken. This week we worked on our Interview Summary Reports for the interviews we had conducted the week prior. It was a great way to see all of the important information from the interview and its experience in one place and gather all thoughts for the actual discourse analysis essay coming up (SLO 2A). I can easily reference it and be productive when writing my actual essay and use it as a baseline draft or outline to guide me on how to structure it and lay out my points (SLO 4B). I will also use correct grammar, punctuation, and spelling as well as properly cite my interview and whatever needs to be cited in my essay (SLO 3A and 3B). All in all, I'm looking forward to writing this discourse analysis essay, because it is something very interesting that I have never done before. I hope that everything continues to go well in the coming weeks!

Blog 6: An Increasing Challenge
We are now eight weeks into school at the University of Arizona, and once again, I am absolutely loving the experience of college and everything that it has to offer, but the courses and workload are only becoming more and more difficult. Although the week prior was already extremely difficult with all of the homework and deadlines, tests, my piano performance, and club meetings along with my other daily activities and necessities, this week somehow managed to be more busy and stressful. This is because I had twice the normal amount of homework for the week and I had an Honors Chemistry exam at the end of the week. Honors Chemistry is one of my favorite classes, but it is definitely also the most difficult. A lot of the material is hard to grasp conceptually, and the class is pretty fast-paced, so it is difficult to keep up and always stay on top of everything. I have gone to all of Dr. <name> office hours whenever he offers them as well as his preceptors' and TAs' office hours to get more individual questions answered and spend more one-on-one time getting a better grasp of the material. However, despite all of my effort, the class is still extremely difficult and although I thought I had a somewhat good understanding of the material before going in to take the exam, I still have no idea how I think I did. I have spent this whole past week stressing and studying for this exam and have spent many sleepless nights trying to understand all of the concepts, and it was driving me nuts. Now it is all in the past, and it is what it is. I am still thoroughly enjoying Professor <name> English 101 class, and it is a great way to start the day. It always relieves some of my stress, and helps me relax and just have a good time while simultaneously learning a lot of valuable information every single class. This last week, we talked about genre conventions and how to analyze a document (SLOs 1A, 1C, 1D). I wrote a couple paragraphs of my Genre Discourse Analysis draft to bring in to class on Friday to discuss with my peers and Professor <name> to get others' perspectives and see if I am on the right track (SLOs 4C, 4D). I then wrote and submitted a complete draft of the essay on Saturday to D2L for Professor <name> to look at and give me feedback for the final version (SLOs 4B, 4D). I thoroughly analyzed every part of the document I was given and cited and mentioned it in my paper (SLOs 2A, 2B). I learned how to take a step back and properly analyze a document. I will be working on the paper this week and will try to improve it as much as possible before submitting the final draft to D2L at the end of the week.
Blog 7: The Transition Into Profiles
We are now ten weeks into school at the University of Arizona, and classes are only becoming more difficult. I am absolutely loving college, and it really has to be the best time of my life, but the workload and the responsibility are reaching insane new levels. Over the past two weeks, I have had double the normal homework and project load and they were all due around the same time. I have had the Genre and Discourse Analysis essay as well as two Econ papers to submit. I have had a piano performance to prepare and practice a ton for. I have interviewed for a major research position at the College of Medicine and am waiting to hear back this week. I have had three tests and 2 quizzes. I have had to add all of my classes for next semester to my cart in UAccess so that I am ready to enroll in them on Thursday morning, which took a total of three days. However, this past weekend was very relaxing, as I went to both the basketball and football games and spent a lot of time with friends. It allowed me to keep a clear mind and focus on all of the upcoming important deadlines and events. Although it is very hard to keep up during the week and make sure that I am always on track and responsible, little breaks like these keep me sane and able to function normally. Our Genre and Discourse Analysis essays were due two Fridays ago, and I talked about my interview with Dr. <name> <name> as well as analyzed one of his weekly notes documents using genres and discourse communities (SLO 1C). I talked about how he adapts to different audiences and purposes and how his document properly fits into every category (SLO 1D). However, I did get a little lower than I initially expected, and I suspect that it might be due to the fact that I did not accurately analyze the document or cover all of the appropriate topics in my paper. I submitted a self-evaluation the following Monday reflecting on how I thought I did on the essay (SLO 4D). Since then, we have been talking about project three in class, which is a Multi-modal Community Profile. We have discussed in great detail what a profile entails and gone over different examples of profiles talking about the same material in order to better understand them. Today in class we each came up with a pitch for what we want to profile in our project, and some of us grouped with others on a pitch that we thought was a great idea. I grouped up with <name> and <name> on profiling the villains from the TV show The Flash. I am looking forward to learning more about this project and how to profile.
Blog 8: And the Profiles Begin
We are now eleven weeks into school at the University of Arizona, and although classes and workloads have become much more difficult, this week was more relaxing and laid-back. I had a lot of free time on my hands that I used to catch up on other areas of interest and extracurriculars as well as make a great deal of progress on my piano piece that I am performing in two weeks and get ahead on different assignments and projects for different classes. I even secured that prestigious research position that I had interviewed for the week prior, and I start in January!! Practically everything is great and seems to be going my way, and I am really enjoying college life right now. I feel like this semester is just whizzing by, and we only have a few weeks left until finals and then winter break! However, the last few weeks remaining are going to be very difficult, and I have a lot of exams and deadlines to worry about. I have my third Honors Chemistry test this coming Friday, and I am very nervous, because not only is the material of this unit extremely challenging, but the test is going to be completely composed of free response questions, making it even more difficult. Also, in order to get an A in the class, I need to do well on the remaining tests to bring up my average test grade and boost my overall grade in the class, so I will be extremely stressed and busy studying for this test all this week. English 101 with Professor <name> is still a blast, and I am enjoying every bit of that class. It is very fun and educational learning about all of these different writing techniques and methods and incorporating them into different kinds of projects that I have never done before. It is opening my eyes to all of the different kinds of writing and documents that exist in the world as well as specifically those that exist in my field of interest. This past week in Professor <name> class, we talked about the differences between primary and secondary research as well as discussed more regarding profiles and different ways to create an appealing profile. We learned that when using and citing information, we have to be very careful to ensure we are using the most accurate and direct information and cite it properly (SLOS 2B, 3B). We also talked about what kinds of analysis each of the members of our profiling group are doing, and in the next class we came prepared reading up about our selected type of analysis and went around to people who read about different kinds of analysis as they educated us about them. I also had other people who read about my specific kind of analysis that educated the people who read about the other kinds of analysis. I personally chose to read about textual analysis. For this week's assignment, we are required to create Field Observation Notes as a basis and a draft for the main project and turn them in before this Friday night (SLO 4B). I now know for the most part how to properly construct a profile, so I am intrigued to see how our group's profile project turns out.

Blog 9: Setting the Guidelines
We are now twelve weeks into school at the University of Arizona, and classes are going relatively well. However, like before, a lot of work, projects, events, club meetings and extracurricular activities are beginning to stack up, and they are all either due or need to be addressed at the same time. Everything is coming to a head in these last few weeks of school, and it is becoming very stressful and very difficult to keep track of everything that is going on. I have started making a lot of sticky notes and lists that I check almost once an hour to make sure that I do not end up missing anything or losing out on something important or valuable. Through all of this, I still know that the first semester of college is almost over, and a fantastic and fun one at that, and then comes a wonderfully long winter break when I can see my family and all of my friends from back home again after a long time. This gives me motive to push through all of the hard work and difficult times, because I know that there is a bright light at the end of the tunnel. English 101 with Professor <name> is still one of the most enjoyable classes I have ever had. We are still doing many fun and educational activities in class, and I am learning a lot of new things not only about research and how to conduct it properly and with the most accuracy, but also about profiles and different methods and techniques of how to properly format and lay out a profile. Last Friday, after conducting a good amount of research and going into the field to record observations, findings, and our thoughts, we all turned in our Fieldwork Observation Notes on D2L to lay the foundation for building our profile. Today in class, we discussed and laid out the purposes, intended audiences, and arguments that we will use in creating our profiles (SLO 1A). We then each came up with three different kinds of thesis sentences that properly encapsulate and describe our profile topic, what it does, and why we chose it. We then went through them all as a group and decided on the one that we were going to use in the actual project. Now we have a great baseline to begin working on our profiles, and our Annotated Bibliographies are due this coming Friday. We will have to properly reference and cite our primary research from multiple sources (SLO 2B, 3B). I am beginning to understand how this entire project works together, and I think that with our topic and our level of research, our group is in a really good place to create a strong profile.
Blog 10: Bibliography and Sources
We are now thirteen weeks into school at the University of Arizona, and managing all of my workload, activities, events, club meetings, and extracurriculars has become extremely difficult. There is a lot of stress regarding not only the amount of work, projects, and tests there have been in the last couple weeks and there will be in the weeks to come, but also regarding the fact that I need to be on top of everything and remember everything that is going on at all times, and it is messing with my head. I have way too many events and club meetings to attend, and even with lists and a planner keeping track of all of them is extremely hard, and I always get confused. I need to check my lists and planner at least once an hour to make sure I am still on track and not forgetting about anything I need to do. Along with this, we have two Economics projects due this week, one was due today and the other is due tomorrow. They are both group projects, and there are five people in our group (including me). However, only me and one other member of the group have worked on the projects, and we ended up doing almost the whole thing without them, which took us a ridiculously long amount of time over many sleepless nights. This has gotten me very frustrated, and simply adds to all the other discomfort and stress that I mentioned above. However, I am leaving campus on Wednesday and going back home to spend Thanksgiving break with my friends and family, and I could not be more excited. I will continue to push through the last few weeks of school remaining, and do the best I can in everything. Professor <name> English 101 class is still great, and one of my favorite classes ever. We have continued doing in-class hands-on activities and discussions with our peers and our project group. This week, we had a foundation for our profile project, and it was time to gather the sources (in proper ALA formatting) and talk about each of them in an Annotated Bibliography. Our group researched the best sources to use for our profiling project, gathered them together on a google doc, drafted a bibliography, talked about each of the sources through summaries and paraphrasing, and then further changed and modified it to fit the grading criteria (SLOs 2A, 2B, 3B, 4B). However, we should have more closely examined the rubric and what was expected of the Annotated Bibliography, because it looks like we did not follow some of the conventions, and should have properly formatted the sources in ALA formatting. We also needed to talk about the validity of the sources themselves. We will properly revise our bibliography based on Professor <name> feedback (SLO 4D). We will now dive into creating the actual profile, and we will be submitting drafts for the project very soon.
