1. What real leadership looks like
a. It's not walking the front, it's pushing from the back, but still being an example
i. Example of pop-culture george washington on boat
ii.Personal example (Vegas soccer game)
1. Taking off armband, showing with actions not words how to lead.
2. Church disobedience
iii. What the personal example taught me and how it shaped how I led
1. It made me realize that the look of it doesn't matter. The personal
recognition doesn't matter. The team > the individual, and that's
what so many people get wrong. They think if they're in a
leadership, they're the most qualified, the best, the shit, but it's
more the opposite. It's getting the most out of everyone around you
and raising the cumulative value rather than the individual value
b. Getting the most out of each individual person
i. If everyone (in a group of 10) is a 5, and you're a 10, that equals 55. If you
make everyone a 6, that's a total of 60. A change of 1 in everyone is more
important than perfection in yourself.
ii. Get the most out of the people around you, still focus on yourself, but true
leadership shapes the environment around them
iii. Use school soccer as a personal reference
c. Trust > Respect (it's all about the environment)
i. Trust changes it from boss -> employee to brotherhood.
ii. Trust brings out the best in people. If you trust them and don't
micromanage them, and they trust you get shit done for them, it creates a
circular relationship where everyone is working for one another and it's
the most productive society.
iii. It's not the people, it's the environment. Don't create competition create
cooperation
1. Find an example in my life where I have seen that change, or at
least been in a negative atmosphere where I see the negative
effects
a. ALTOS IN CHOIR vs the Bass section
2. Psychological safety
iv. It all comes down to attitude
d. How has this impacted my life. What's the change that I've seen from taking
leadership compared to earning it. Building the right environment. How will it
impact my future
Choose a CLEAR audience that you have understanding of leadership in that community, and
have them understand your viewpoint
Definition of business
Leadership should be based on the community and not the individual
Explain what leadership is/should be
