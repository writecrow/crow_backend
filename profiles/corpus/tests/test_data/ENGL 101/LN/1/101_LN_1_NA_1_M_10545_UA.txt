Showing For Those Who Can't Tell
Between elementary school and middle school, I switched school districts from <name> to their rival, <name> The transition from one level of school to the next is always hard, but imagine also switching school districts and being the new kid. Everyone already had their clique and I was left on the sidelines. The popular kids didn't want to associate with a nobody, the nerdy kids didn't know what video games I liked, and the athletic kids didn't let me join their team because I was short and skinny. I couldn't just jump into someone's friend group; that would be rude and intrusive. But being lonely is soul-crushing. The thought that nobody wants you gets into your head and never comes out. This, along with some home factors that I would prefer not to get into, led me to develop social anxiety. If no one wanted me, I could always count on myself. I knew that for sure. I retreated into my own little world, free from friends and family. After a year or so, I did make a few close friends that I stuck with all the way through high school. These friends have become my go-to people and they have introduced me to different groups and ideas that allowed me to grow socially. To this day, I'm still not an extrovert or socially outgoing by any stretch of the imagination; I still spend most of my time by myself. But I am much more confident in myself than I was at age 12.
In addition to be socially anxious, I was generally considered to be the smart kid. While I would disagree (I am good at absorbing information, but not synthesizing it), the fact that I was passing honors and AP classes with straight A's didn't help my case. This meant one thing, though: my brain worked faster than my mouth. I often stumble with words and, when discussing concepts with others, I usually have to go back and revise what I said because I thought a few more steps ahead. So when I can't let the ideas flow through words, I have to find a more efficient way to let them out.
The spigot that allows me to let my ideas flow freely came in 8th grade English. We had a unit on short stories halfway through the year and the final project for the unit was simple: make a short film based on one of them. I only had one friend in that class and, lucky for us, "The Treasure of Lemon Brown" only had five characters. The math doesn't seem to work, but we made it work by simply playing more than one character. At this point in time, cinematic continuity was not my strong point. I went over to my friend's house with a handheld camcorder from my dad's basement and held it up with a tripod made from a cheap telescope mount, paper clips, and rubber bands. After filming, I edited the video with the free Windows Movie Maker software. While the final video file is long gone by now, at the time of the assignment, we got a 100% on it. Seeing that number opened my eyes to the possibility that maybe I found something that I was good at: making short films.
Later that year, I was in a study hall with another friend. I finished my homework early and I saw him writing something everyday, so I went over to see what he was doing. He said he was writing a book about secret agents that leaked government secrets. Being middle schoolers, that was the most thrilling idea ever put to paper in the history of literature to us. Think about it: secret agents, government conspiracies, and probably walking away from an explosion without looking back.
With the number 100 still seared in my mind, I brought up another creative possibility: we could work together to make it a You Tube series, the only medium where kids like us could get recognition. He agreed and we went to work. We quickly found ourselves in a predicament because of our limited knowledge of how networks worked, so we often spent hours consulting the Internet to figure out why we couldn't join the same online server. Once we did meet up online, another problem arose: creative differences. A filmmaker's worst nightmare, when the image you had envisioned for weeks comes crumbling down simply because the other director "didn't like it." We made many compromises that left us both unsatisfied with the final product, but we eventually made the pilot episode of our show. It's no longer on You Tube, but I still have the original video file, which will I will never allow to see the light of day again. But this terrible trailer taught me something important about films: their inherently collaborative nature. One cannot make a film by themselves: it requires a whole team of people working behind the scenes. While this team may not agree on every idea, that's part of the fun. Getting to see new ideas come to fruition right before your eyes will never cease to make my eyes sparkle with joy.
At this point, high school was just starting. Armed with friends and confidence, I wanted to put myself out into the world of real life experience. I wanted to hone my filmmaking skills by learning the actual techniques that famous directors use. So, I joined <name> Productions, my high school's film club. Taught by an English teacher and the TV Studio director, I learned the ins and outs of camera settings, cinematography, and editing techniques. Based off of what I learned, I bought my own camera: the Panasonic G7. It was a young filmmaker's dream camera because it provided 4K resolution for cheap. Now, most filmmakers know that resolution isn't everything. Good video also depends on settings such as dynamic range, recording codecs, and data bitrates, but that's outside of the scope of this story. But that camera was mine and I was about to make the best of it.
After playing around with the camera for a bit, I decided to put my skills to the test. With the recent announcement of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I decided to make a short film based on the Star Wars universe. Armed with my newfound knowledge and my family as actors, I brought my first original film idea to life.
During production, I hit a few snags that required the ingenuity of a true filmmaker to overcome. For one, I had to create landscapes that I could not access in real life: the inside of a TIE fighter, a deserted planet, and the inside of a desolate factory. These could easily be fixed through the use of a cheap green screen. Another problem quickly arose: how to get the TIE fighter to come down from the sky and land in my front yard. For this, I had to improvise a green screen. I took sheets of green colored paper and took still photos of a toy TIE fighter whose orientation could be changed during editing. I will admit, I was quite proud of that solution. But the biggest problem came from something that I couldn't take pictures of: lightsabers and laser blasters. For the lightsaber, I took sheets of blue colored paper and taped it to a cardboard tube. For the laser blaster, I had to look to an independent young filmmaker's best resource: royalty free You Tube videos. I found a laser effect on You Tube, which I may or may not have illegally downloaded and put into my film without permission from the creator.
This is the struggle for all filmmakers, young or old, new or experienced, independent or backed by a major studio. We all face problems that require different solutions. Sometimes, it can be solved using practical methods, like the toy TIE fighter. Other times, it requires extensive editing, like the laser blaster. But no matter what is being made or who is making it, films are about solving problems. This goes far beyond the film itself; for me, my problem was trouble communicating with others. This community of high school filmmakers allowed me to express my original ideas without fear of ridicule and create new friends. Like the 100% on the short film assignment, it allowed me to realize that there are people out there who would want to hear my ideas. These all gave me the confidence to grow as a person, both personally and socially. Now, I am no longer afraid to meet new people and put in my two cents.
As for what I plan on doing with filmmaking, that's a bit easier to say now that I feel more open about my ideas. I currently have a script written for a feature length film that I plan to film next year. In order to better the look of my films, I am taking a 35mm film camera on a trip to Puerto Rico with my family this winter. This will force me to think about every shot in advance and get all of the settings perfect on the first try in order to not waste any film. In addition, I also have an idea for an experimental short film that I plan to start writing.
