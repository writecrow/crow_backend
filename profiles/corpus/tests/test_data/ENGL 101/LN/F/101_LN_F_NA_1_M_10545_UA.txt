Showing For Those Who Can't Tell
Between elementary school and middle school, I switched school districts from <name> <name>
to their rival, <name> Stepping up from one level of school to the next is always hard, but
imagine also switching school districts and being the new kid. The popular kids didn't want to
associate with a nobody, the nerdy kids didn't know what video games I liked, and the athletic
kids didn't let me join their team because I was short and skinny. I couldn't just jump into
someone's friend group; that would be rude and intrusive. But being lonely is soul-crushing. The
thought that nobody wants you got into my head and forced upon me social anxiety. If no one
wanted me, I could always count on myself, I thought. After a year or so, I did make a few close
friends that have introduced me to different groups and ideas that allowed me to grow socially.
To this day, I'm still not an extrovert or socially outgoing by any stretch of the imagination; I
still spend most of my time by myself. But I am much more confident in myself than I was at age
12.
In addition to being socially anxious, I was generally considered to be the smart,
straight-A's-in-honors-classes kid. This meant one thing, though: my brain worked faster than
my mouth. I often stumble with words and, when discussing any concept with others, I usually
have to go back and revise what I said because I thought a few more steps ahead. So when I can't
let the ideas flow through words, I have to find a more efficient way to let them out.
The spigot that allows me to let my ideas flow freely came halfway through 8th grade
English. The last project for our short story unit was simple: make a short film based on a short
story we read. I only had one friend in that class and "The Treasure of Lemon Brown" only had
five characters. The math doesn't seem to work, but we made it work by simply playing more
than one character. I went over to my friend's house with a handheld camcorder from my dad's
basement and held it up with a tripod made from a cheap telescope mount, paper clips, and
rubber bands. After filming, I edited the video with the free Windows Movie Maker software.
While the final video file is long gone by now, at the time of the assignment, we earned a 100%
on it. Seeing that number opened my eyes to the possibility that maybe I found something that I
was good at: making films.
Later that year, I was in a study hall with another friend. I finished my homework early
and I saw him writing something everyday, so I went over to his table to see what he was doing.
He said he was writing a book about secret agents that leaked government secrets. Being middle
schoolers, that was the most thrilling idea ever put to paper in the history of literature to us:
secret agents, government conspiracies, and walking away from explosions without looking
back. It was a one-way ticket to being cool.
With the number 100 still seared in my mind, I brought up another creative possibility:
we could work together to make it a You Tube series, the only platform where kids like us could
get recognition. He agreed and we went to work. We quickly found ourselves in a predicament
because of our limited knowledge of how networks worked: we couldn't join the same online
server, which meant that we couldn't communicate with each other. Hours of consulting
unanswered Internet forum posts eventually led us to a solution that allowed us to talk and
continue on with our plan. However, our discussions led to another problem: creative
differences. It's a filmmaker's worst nightmare: the vision you had perfected for weeks comes
crumbling down simply because the other director "didn't like it." After many of these
compromises that left us both unsatisfied with the final product, we eventually uploaded the pilot
episode of our show. It's no longer on You Tube, but I still have the original video file, which I
will never allow to see the light of day again. But this terrible trailer taught me about the
inherently collaborative nature of films. One cannot make a film by themselves; rather, it
requires a whole team of people working relentlessly behind the scenes. While this team may not
agree on every idea, that's part of the fun. Getting to see new ideas come to fruition right before
you will never cease to make my eyes sparkle with joy.
At this point, high school was just starting. Armed with friends and confidence, I wanted
to put myself out into the world of real life filmmaking experience by learning the actual
techniques used by famous directors. So, I joined <name> Productions, my high school's film
club. Taught by an English teacher and the head of the TV Studio, I learned the ins and outs of
camera settings, cinematography, and editing techniques. Based off of the recommendation of
the teacher, I bought my own camera: the Panasonic G7. It was a young filmmaker's dream
camera because it provided 4K resolution for cheap. Now, most filmmakers know that resolution
isn't everything; good video also depends on settings such as dynamic range, recording codecs,
and data bitrates, but that's outside of the scope of this story. What mattered was that the camera
was mine and I was about to make the best of it.
I wanted to put my skills to the test after the then-recent announcement of Star Wars: The
Force Awakens. I decided to make a short film based on the Star Wars universe. With my
newfound knowledge and my family as actors, I brought my first original film idea to life.
During production, I hit a few snags that required the ingenuity of a true filmmaker to
overcome. For one, I had to create landscapes that I could not access in real life: the inside of a
TIE fighter, a deserted planet, and the inside of a desolate factory. These could easily be fixed
through the use of a cheap green screen. Another problem quickly arose: how to get the TIE
fighter to fly down from the sky and land in my front yard. For this, I had to improvise. I took
sheets of green colored paper and photographed a toy TIE fighter whose orientation could be
changed during editing. I will admit, I was quite proud of that solution. But the biggest problem
came from something that I couldn't take pictures of: lightsabers and laser blasters. For the
lightsaber, I took sheets of blue colored paper and taped it to a cardboard tube. For the laser
blaster, I had to look to an independent young filmmaker's best resource: royalty free You Tube
videos. I found a laser effect on You Tube, which I may or may not have downloaded and put
into my film without permission from the creator.
This is the struggle for all filmmakers, regardless of age, experience, or finances. We all
face problems that require unique solutions. Sometimes, it can be solved using practical methods,
like the toy TIE fighter. Other times, it requires extensive editing, like the laser blaster. But no
matter what is being made or who is making it, films are about solving problems. This often
extends far beyond the film itself. For me, my problem was trouble communicating with others.
The high school filmmaking community allowed me to express my original ideas without fear
and create new friends. Like the 100% on the short film assignment, it allowed me to realize that
there are people out there who would want to hear my ideas. These all gave me the confidence to
grow as a person, both personally and socially. Now, I am no longer afraid to meet new people
and put in my two cents.
As for what I plan on doing with filmmaking, that's a bit easier to say now that I am more
open about my ideas. I currently have a script written for a feature-length film that I plan to film
next year. In order to better the look of my films, I am taking a 35 millimeter film camera on
vacation to Puerto Rico with my family this winter. This will force me to think about every shot
in advance in order to not waste any film. In addition, I also have an idea for an experimental
short film that I plan to start writing.
