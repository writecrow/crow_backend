How I am like Blue Cheese
and now a man. There have been a few experiences that have altered my life for the better and
for the worse. My goal is to show the readers and in a way myself what has made me me. Years
and years have gone by where I have tried to tackle this idea, but just like in football the ideas
have hurdled, spinned, or knocked me down. In my life I have always been "the new kid" and
people have always assumed the same, but the reality is that there is more to me than meets the
eye. In my life until high school I was never at a school longer than two years, this made me
constantly make new friends and in the same breath, to make myself more reserved and quiet. In
the process of always moving I developed to the kid who sat in the back and was quiet and
reserved. My goal is to make it clear that it is perfectly okay to be that way. I plan to show all
how a Nashville boy became a natural Southern California native, and how God and friends have
had an impact on me in my everyday life.
The audience may not see it but I am and will always be a Nashville boy at heart. I was
born at <name> hospital in downtown Nashville Tennessee. I lived in Franklin just
outside of the city and it was great, that's where all of my friends were, all of my teams, and my
school. It had absolutely everything I needed. Until one day my dad dropped the bomb, "Guys so
I have some news, after a long talk with your mother we decided to move to Palm Springs. I'll be
leaving at christmas to go work and you guys will finish school." It was silent in the room until I
said,
"What about my friends, my school, why?"
I was so confused and was in shock. My brother and sister we younger but it still had a large
impact on them. I didn't want to believe it, but then it happened, my dad left to go to Palm
Springs, we stayed, and everything began to change. It seemed like everyday was gloomy, school
was pointless, and every conversation with my friends felt like my last. My mom was exhausted
but made everything count, and the sleepless nights in order to make sure we were okay we're
never accounted for. I can talk all day about how hard it was but if I never moved then I would
not be a champion, a brother to my team, I would never have had a chance to go to the Naval
Academy, and I would have never met the girl who I fell in love with. I reflect often about if I
would have done things differently but the fact is no, I would not because God works in
mysterious ways and this may have been one of the biggest blessings in my life.
I have always believed in God, my father is a very religious person, and he made
sure to instill that into me and my siblings. I went to a Jesuit high school, a very religious order,
and there we did a lot of reflecting and contemplation on who we are and what our purpose is.
My senior year I lead a retreat where this may have been the biggest fight with this idea. I talked
about all of these ideas and how I think this is what made me. I believe I moved for a reason, and
I listed those above, but I am a big believer that we are all placed for a reason. In this reterat is
when I saw God in other people, it was made clear to me when one night one of my best friends
went to the stand and said, <name> has changed my life, on the outside he is a quiet person,
someone who doesn't draw attention to himself, but at the same time has enough impact to
change your life for the better." This is <name> <name> has been one of my best friends since I moved
here he was the first person to show me around my new school and if it wasn't for how outgoing
he was I would not have prospered the way I did. I met him the day I shadowed and he
convinced me to play Water Polo and to challenge myself. It was in that moment I knew I was
here for a reason. I was here to me, not to be anyone else, but to be <name> For a while I always
thought I needed to be someone else, someone who wasnt me. Reflection has been apart of my
life for so long it only makes sense that I still participate in it. In this reflection I hope to show
that as hard as this may seem I know who I am and if I am ever lost I can find my way back
because I have done it before.
I am a person who on the surface is reserved and shy. I sit in the back of class and don't
say much, I do my work and keep my head down. It is only when you dig deeper is it when you
fn out who I am. I am an athlete, a brother, a son, born and raised in Nashville, reside in
Southern California. There is more to me than people know, and that is my message is that there
are people all around us that we don't know a lot about. It is only when we dig deeper do we find
out who the person truly is and what makes them who they are. It is hard to have new beginnings
and I have been through plenty and know what it feels like. It makes the person more diverse and
that isn't bad, makes me who I am.
One of the main points that I would like the audience to see in this piece is that as many
problems I think I have, I have just as many if not more blessings in my life. Moving from the
Rocky Top to where the surf meets the turf is quite a change. My parents drilled many things
into my head as a young man but one thing that stayed with me was, "Change is like blue cheese,
it looks nasty and moldy on the outside, but with the right people, or wings it can be amazing." I
live my life like that, not the analogy, but change. I have gone through enough change in my life,
not being at a school longer than two years, and moving that its enough for a lifetime, but that's
the night about life. Its ever changing, ever moving, and ever evolving. I am forever thankful for
the people who have helped me, and molded me. Life may be like blue cheese but so am I, under
the surface I am more diverse than most, and have a story to tell. That is who i'm attempting to
reach in this, people who have gone through multiple changes in their life and who are fellow
blue cheese. I am <name> <name>, and I have taken the path less traveled but that isn't such a
bad thing, it makes me, me. I am proud of that.
