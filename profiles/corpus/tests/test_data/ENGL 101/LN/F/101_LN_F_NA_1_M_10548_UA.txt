I'm sure we've all seen it. George Washington sailing across the Delaware, eyes on the
future. He stands there so elegantly, almost asking to be marvelled at. A true leader, standing
above his peers, while they rowed him through the icy waters to shore. In the movies, the leader
was the highschool football quarterback. The face of everything. Everyone had to love him, just
because he was the best. I had learned all of my life to accept that those depictions of people
were depictions of true leaders. Growing up, I thought that's always who I had to be. I thought I
had to be the center of attention, the best at everything, and the perfect conversationalist, I
thought I had to be perfect. It took me years to realize how leaders aren't meant to be in the front.
They're meant to push from behind. Leaders catalyze change in the people around them, and not
in themselves.
My soccer team and I had a tournament in Vegas. And we got smoked. We lost our first
three games, in very poor fashion. Everyone was angry at each other, they were angry at
themselves. As captain, I took no responsibility. I was the best player on the team. I had the
armband. Everyone else was dragging me down. Of course it wasn't my fault, it never was. Like
the quarterbacks in the movie, if they tried their best and lost, it was everyone else who let them
down. I tried to be content that thought, but it just didn't feel right. After years of working the
hardest, doing what it took to be the best and have that armband sitting on my right bicep, why
wasn't I satisfied. We were going into the last game, and I couldn't wrap my brain around the
feeling. I just swallowed it and marched on the field with my eyes up, and head high. Five
minutes in, we were pinned. Our defense was scrambling for their lives. I counted the shots that
went off of the post. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. How the hell are we still in this game? We
barely make it to half time. Our defense is exhausted, our forwards are frustrated, and I'm just
confused. What's going wrong? This team isn't that much better than us. I got angry. Why am I
suffering from my team's inadequacy? Why do I have to be the captain of this team? In a fit of
rage I threw my armband off. What is the point of a stupid armband? And then it hit me. The
armband means nothing. Captaincy means nothing if you aren't leading the team. I spent the
entire weekend thinking of ways to justify why I wasn't at fault, but yet I was the entire time. I
was being the star. I was the best player on the field. But that's useless if everyone around you is
struggling. And there's me, standing there in all of my glory doing nothing about it. I knew what
I had to do. I walk on the field calmy, eyes to the ground, head down. There was a new vigor
inside of me. I couldn't explain it, but my mindset had changed. I was ready to lead this team.
The beginning of the half started the same way as the last one. I desperately scanned looking for
every weakness, but I couldn't find one. I cleared the ball up to give our team some time. Their
keeper received it, kicked it, but kicked it in the completely wrong spot. That was it. We had to
pressure the keeper. Next time I got the ball, I kicked it as hard as I could to their keeper. I heard
shouts from the parents, from the bench, and from my coach yelling "What the hell are you
doing!" As I start sprinting down the field, I hear the yelling get louder. What is he doing? Why
is he tiring himself out like that. I have my eyes locked on the keeper. 30 yards. He still has the
ball. 20. Still has it. 10. I see the panic in his eyes. He kicks it straight back at me. The ball
deflects off me, back off of him, and out for a corner. The team understood. They saw the
weakness. Not because I told them, but because I showed them. We pressured their keeper, and
their defense time and time again. It was our only chance. They got frantic. They stopped passing
to their keeper. They started making dumb mistakes. We fought our way back into the game. I
could tell the time was ticking down. We needed to score, and fast. I drive the ball down the field
with everything I have left in my legs. I get to the middle of their half, and see <name> cutting inside
for a pass. I knock it to him, he knocks it back. I let the ball run across my body, and I hit it as
hard as I can with my left foot. I fall, tumbling with no strength in my legs and a ton of
momentum throwing me forward. As I roll to a stop I expect to hear sounds of disappointment.
But I don't. I hear cheers. I sit up. The keeper had his face in his hands, and the ball was in the
back of the net. We did it.
All it took was one moment for me to realize that I had been trying to be the wrong kind
of leader all of my life. The most effective form of leadership is cultivating the people around
you to be better. It even makes sense with a math equation. If you're in a group of 10, and on a
scale of 1-10, everyone around you is a 5, and you're a 10, that's only 55. But if you make each
person one point better, that's 60. Five points better. It's so simple, and honestly obvious. I've
seen this impact my soccer teams since then, I've seen it impact my relationships, but most
importantly I've seen it impact people I don't know. At my old school (the school was grades
7-12) I saw kids younger than me learn from my greatest traits. They saw the best parts in me,
the kindness, the uplifting spirit, and my compassion and applied it to their lives. And in my
experience, that's what true leadership is. It is lighting the way for people. It's showing them
how to be better, not showing them why you're the best. It's about actions not abilities. Applying
this to my life has not only made me happier, but also the people around me happier, and that's
something that's invaluable.
