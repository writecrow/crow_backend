Practice, Patience, and The Pursuit of Ukulele Mastery
Learning a new skill whether it be a language, sport, or an instrument is difficult for anyone at the beginning of the process. Unless someone is a child prodigy who can pick up algebra at the age of four, there are bound to be bumps in the road. Speaking from personal experience, there were many moments when I faced frustration and had the option to either persevere or give up, and that is exactly what I did when I decided to learn how to play an instrument. When I was in the 8th grade, I used the money from I was given for my 14th birthday to buy a ukulele from e Bay. I was never really a musical child growing up, but I was at the age where I wasn't satisfied with anything about myself and the music that I listened to helped me get through daily life. The ukulele was gaining popularity around this time and it seemed easy enough for me to just go ahead and try it. I wanted to do something different that would hopefully help me gain control of what I wanted to do with my life and where I wanted to go. I knew what I wanted wasn't something that would come easily to me, but I was willing to put in the time and effort to achieve my goal.
After purchasing my first ukulele, I then had to learn the slang that related to the instrument. The first thing that became obvious to me was that certain anatomical terms came with it. The body, the neck, the fretboard, the tuning keys, and various other parts; I was beyond overwhelmed and had no idea where to start. I had never played an instrument and neither had anyone I knew, so I turned to the one thing I did know: You Tube. I found that watching other people play and learning different techniques that worked for them helped me improve drastically. After practicing for an entire day, I began to form thick, rough, calluses on the tips of my fingers. My hands ached with pain, but the melodies of the strings filled my room day and night for what was months and then years. I soon found myself able to read chord tabs and memorized what positions my fingers needed to be in just by reading it out. The muscle memory I built up allowed me to slowly but surely improve and form the love I have for playing music. To quote Chimamanda Adichie, "They stirred my imagination. They opened up new words for me." Every song I learned on the ukulele inspired me to do more and do better. It didn't really matter what the songs I played were about or if they were sad or upbeat songs, the act of playing alone motivated me to improve. I knew I had to practice as much as I could if I wanted to see improvement. My practice continued to get more intense and serious despite the discouragement that came from those around me.
I had wanted a ukulele for several months before my birthday came around. Whenever I had brought up wanting to buy a ukulele, my family threw negative comments at me such as, "Why buy it if it's just going to sit in your room?" or "You're too lazy to learn an instrument." My mother was so fed up with the idea that she screamed, "That was such a waste of money!" when I informed her of my purchase. Music had never been a part of my family so something foreign to them seemed impossible and ridiculous. Every time I looked at my ukulele, all the hope I had built up began to fade. Everyone I was close to didn't believe that I could possibly teach myself how to play an instrument because in their eyes I was lazy and unmotivated. Little did they know that their constant degradation only pushed me further and motivated me to prove everyone wrong. Every negative comment they threw at me only encouraged me to set even higher goals. In those moments, I knew I had to prove them wrong and keep playing because I loved it. My progress and literacy improved each day. New techniques such as fingerpicking and chucking allowed the songs I played to sound even more advanced and well-rehearsed. My close friends soon began encouraging me to play outside of my small dark bedroom and try playing at a public event.
At that point, it had been 7 months since I had purchased my ukulele. As sudden as it seems, I somehow ended up being asked to play at a local coffee shop in my town. The act consisted of my friend singing along to my ukulele accompaniment. I remember the dimmed lights of the cafe making all the faces glaring at me stand out. It was my first official performance besides the times I had played in front of my friends, and I wasn't even sure if I had prepared enough. My thoughts and overwhelming fear were soon interrupted by the mumbles and hushing of the crowd as I sat on what was meant to be a stage. My friend I were introduced by the host of the night and every word she said went in one ear and out the other. The months I spent practicing and the several restless nights had all lead up to this and at that moment, it felt as though all those hours I had spent practicing to impress 25 people I didn't know disappeared. However, as my friend began to sing, I went into autopilot as my hands took over and played exactly the way they were supposed to. The satisfaction I had after performing was something like no other. Being able to see the months of practice finally pay off made me even more determined to continue and get better. It's amazing how much information is on the internet and how much of that information is about the ukulele.
My first big milestone assured me that this instrument was a part of me and not something I would forget in a couple of years. I was even motivated to go off and participate in my school's talent show for the next few years. Everyone at school knew me as the girl who could play the ukulele, and every year someone would come up to me and ask if I would be performing again. I found myself transitioning from watching tutorials on You Tube to offering advice and lessons to other aspiring ukulele players in my town. This, of course, would not have happened if it weren't for the wonders of time. The idea of time allowed me to have patience in myself and practice consistently. Despite having a difficult time at the beginning of my journey, I found that if I was motivated and dedicated enough to learn the ukulele, I could push through any obstacle until I improved. I can't claim to be a professional player, simply because I'm far from perfect. However, in a similar way to how I've gotten to where I am right now in my literacy skills in the ukulele, every professional got to where they are through a common theme: practice, patience, and a passion for whatever it is they do or play.
