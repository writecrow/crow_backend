The Flash Television show which was developed by Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg,
and Geoff Johns is based on the DC Comics character Barry Allen / Flash, a superhero with the
power to move at superhuman speeds, fighting crime with his special abilities. The show has 6
seasons on the CW Network, spearheaded by the main actor Grant Gustin. This show takes place
in the Arrowverse, which essentially means it takes place in the same time and place that the
earlier show, Green Arrow, was placed in. The show has very strong reviews among the public,
with an 89% like rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and has a very passionate fan-base. As we
discovered through our research, many people are dedicated to this TV series, and are willing to
share that. Through online reviews and personal interaction, we got to see first-hand how the
community communicated, and the significance of it.
To begin, we went out into the public and asked people of this community about their
opinions on the show. They seemed to be a little taken aback that they were being approached in
person. Of course they were all willing to speak, and also very passionate, but we could tell that
people felt a little weird. These people were very attached to characters, doing deep into their
knowledge and theories about the Flash. From the heroes, to the villains, to anyone stuck in
between, the fans all had something to say, generally all positive too. They went on and on about
the development of the story arc, and how it affected each character and the world surrounding
them. An important observation was that people often tended to talk about the later seasons. We
found this important because that showed dedication and commitment to the show. Many people
would quit after the first or second season, but members of the community stuck with the show
and watched it all the way through. Though the personal feedback was positive, it still seemed
that other than conventions and other planned meetups, people tend to not speak too much about
this in person unless it comes up in casual conversation. However, we found that the most
influential medium these fans connect through is through the Internet.
Our field notes were comprised of observations that I made by reading various websites
that went more into depth about the show The Flash. There are a few main parts to the show that
have made it as attractive as we are making it seem. It consists of family love, team building, and
overcoming challenges everyone faces. Throughout all six seasons of The Flash the suits that
Barry Allen has worn have been all have been different and in different ways, they provide hope
and a fighting cause. The emblem on his chest means something to the people that he is
protecting. The villains that are presented in each season also have the same effect to an extent.
They make the team come together more and more, until they acted as one and unlike a group of
individuals. The Flash shows how to overcome the odds that have been set time after time. Our
notes reflect that and that is what got us to fall in love with the show.
With open platforms to present all of their ideas and opinions, it is very easy to connect
with like-minded people who are also very passionate about the show. Specifically with the
internet, we see that when people see others with the same passion and the same opinions, there
is an immediate attraction and a community is formed. This community transforms into a
discourse community through further discussion of all of the different aspects of the show and
sharing a common love of the show. In this case, the discourse community happens to be an
extensive global fanbase. This discourse community formed naturally, because people generally
like to express and share their opinions, thoughts, and feelings on such things like shows online
to the public on social media such as twitter, instagram, snapchat, etc. along with websites and
forums. All of these are then seen by many others who probably feel the same way, so there is a
natural community that is formed, which over time creates a massive fanbase for the show.
Through our research and personal experience, we have found that there is a stronger
fanbase than expected. People from all around the world are willing to speak on their opinion of
the show. They link up over something we all consider entertainment, and make lasting
connections through something seemingly insignificant. On an even greater scale, not only just
for this community, but anyone who is interested in anything superheroes can connect with
others worldwide, discovering and sharing many ideas surrounding this universe that our
ever-increasing technology has provided us access to. This community is a perfect example of
how beneficial these relationships can be, just based off of the positive feedback and
collaboration members get to experience.
