The University of Arizona doesn't have a clear Bachelor's program in cybersecurity. It
has a Master's program, but it's Bachelor's programs are scattered online, in the Eller College of
Management, and in two different areas of study in the College of Engineering. Because of the
rapid pace technology is being created and integrated, there is an increasing need for
professionals who know how to protect these technologies. In fact, the cybersecurity job market
has "negative unemployment," meaning that there are more available jobs than qualified people
going into these jobs (Lloyd). So where are undergraduate students to turn if they intend to
pursue a career in the growing cybersecurity sector?
One resource for these students is the University of Arizona Information Defenders club,
better known as the "Cyber Cats." Their goal is to give students with an interest in cybersecurity
the resources, knowledge, and connections to get a head start in their cybersecurity career. The
club's Involve UA page captures this perfectly, stating that their goal is "to equip [their] members
through knowledge, experience, and networking opportunities" ("Arizona Information
Defenders"). They strive to meet this goal by holding weekly meetings in conjunction with
(ISC)2.
These weekly meetings occur every Thursday from 6 PM to 8 PM in the <place> building,
("University of Arizona Cyber Cats"). These meetings are co-sponsored by the
University of Arizona and the Phoenix chapter of the (ISC)2 ("University of Arizona
Cyber Cats"), which stands for the International Information System Security Certification
Consortium. The (ISC)2's goal is to standardize the education and certifications of cybersecurity
professionals in order to keep the methods of securing data systems up to date and free of any
vulnerabilities. ("Our Vision"). So, by reaching out to university students interested in
cybersecurity before they go into the industry, they are able to provide them with the tools
necessary to get a head start in their careers straight out of college. This is a great opportunity for
students because the scattered University of Arizona classes makes it very difficult to take
classes that teach the standards already in place in the cybersecurity field.
At these meetings, they teach about a multitude of topics relating to cybersecurity: jobs
available in the industry, recent major events in the field, how to prevent malware and viruses,
and how to hack websites. For example, at a recent meeting, they discussed cybersecurity news
relating to a cybersecurity attack in Iran, jobs in the energy sector, and vulnerabilities in Apple
i Tunes. Additionally, <name> <name> a graduate student at the University of Arizona, gave a small
lecture on how to prevent viruses from being distributed through Microsoft products. Other
members also briefly discussed job openings at the defense contractor Raytheon, vulnerabilities
in the operating system Linux, and the Cyber Cat's Capture the Flag team. For those unfamiliar,
Capture the Flag in cybersecurity is a competition where members of the club attempt to hack a
website built to have vulnerabilities in it.
Before joining the Cyber Cats, students do not need to have a background in computers or
programming. In fact, a few members are business and system management majors. However,
having some knowledge of coding and computer systems will be a huge help in understanding
the material discussed during club meetings. This is because they often use official cybersecurity
language, which may come off as foreign to people who are going to their first meeting blind.
For example, members used the terms "botnet," "zero day," "network segmentation," and "host
isolation" during their last meeting. So, if these words appear foreign, then some light studying
may be a good option.
However, if an interested student does have a background in cybersecurity, whether it be
from prior independent research or cybersecurity courses they have taken, they may be in luck.
Because many other Cyber Cat members are directly involved with the University of Arizona's
information technology services, they may be able to use these connections to get a position with
them. By simply working with these other members and (ISC)2, students will be able to obtain
the skills and certifications necessary to possibly gain a position on their team. This would allow
them to gain useful, hands-on experience in the local cybersecurity field. From here, they can use
this experience to advance quickly in their future career. This is especially useful in the 21st
century because many higher up positions in both the government and technology companies are
willing to pay large amounts to students who have previous experience.
If any students do decide to join, they should not expect to be greeted by a classroom full
of shadowy figures. At one meeting, there were only 11 people, many of whom were just
students pursuing their degree or professionals in the cybersecurity industry. The reason for the
small number of members is because of their advertising methods; the Cyber Cats do not have
any physical posters or flyers. Rather, they rely on word of mouth and social media accounts for
their advertising <name> This small group means that members can often work 1-on-1 with
professionals from (ISC)2, Raytheon, and the University of Arizona itself. If students were
looking to work with professors, however, they may be out of luck. The advisor for the club,
College of Engineering professor <name> <name> was not present at the last meeting.
If any students were thinking of joining and wanted to gauge where their hacking skills
stand, the Cyber Cats have a test game to play. It can be found at https://game.cybercats.io/ . Once
more interested students join, they can expect to work on Capture the Flag teams <name>
From there, the Cyber Cats Capture the Flag teams hope to attend Cactus Con, a 2 day conference
in Mesa, Arizona that focuses on information technology and security ("What We Do"). If any
students would like to advance their cybersecurity career, participate in hacking competitions, or
just learn more about the topic, then the University of Arizona Cyber Cats may be a good fit. Any
questions or concerns can be directed to the Cyber Cat's official email, <email>
