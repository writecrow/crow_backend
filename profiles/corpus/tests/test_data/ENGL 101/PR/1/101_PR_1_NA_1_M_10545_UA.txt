The University of Arizona doesn't have a clear Bachelor's program in cybersecurity. It
has a Master's program, but nothing much for undergraduates. So where are students to turn if
they intend to pursue a career in the growing cybersecurity sector? One resource for these
Their goal, as stated by their Involve UA page, is "to equip [their] members through knowledge,
experience, and networking opportunities" ("Arizona Information Defenders"). Just how exactly
do they do this?
They have meetings every Thursday from 6-8 PM ("University of Arizona Cyber Cats").
At these meetings, they teach about a multitude of topics relating to cybersecurity: jobs in the
industry, recent topics in the field, how to prevent hacking, and how to hack. At a recent
meeting, they discussed cybersecurity news relating to Iran, the energy sector, and i Tunes.
Additionally, <name> <name> a graduate student at the University of Arizona, gave a brief lecture
on how to prevent ransomware distributed through Microsoft products. Other members also
briefly discussed job openings at Raytheon, a Capture the Flag team, and vulnerabilities in
Linux.
Before joining the Cyber Cats, students do not need to have a background in computers or
programming. In fact, a few members are business and system management majors. However,
having some knowledge of coding and computer systems will be a huge help in understanding
the material discussed during club meetings. This is because they often use official cybersecurity
language, which may come off as foreign to people who are going to their first meeting blind.
For example, they used the terms "botnet," "zero day," "network segmentation," and "host
isolation" during their last meeting. So, if these words appear foreign, then some light studying
may be a good option.
If any students do decide to join, they should not expect to be greeted by a full classroom
of shadowy figures. At one meeting, there were only 11 people, many of whom were just
students pursuing their degree. The reason for the small number of people is because of their
advertising methods; the Cyber Cats do not have any physical posters or flyers. Rather, they rely
on word of mouth and social media accounts for their advertising. This means that members can
often work 1-on-1 with professionals from (ISC)2, Raytheon, and the University of Arizona
itself. If students were looking to work with professors, they may be out of luck. The advisor for
the club, College of Engineering professor <name> <name> was not present at the last meeting. In
addition, most members are either working in the industry or are graduate students working
towards their degree, as stated before.
If any students were thinking of joining and wanted to gauge where they stand, the
Cyber Cats have a test game to play. It can be found at https://game.cybercats.io/ . Once these
students join, they can expect to work on Capture the Flag teams. This is when a website is
created with vulnerabilities built in and different hacking teams work to try and expose these
vulnerabilities. The team that does it the fastest wins the Capture the Flag contest. If this sounds
intriguing, then the Cyber Cats may be a good fit.
