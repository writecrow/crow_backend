ASMRtists on You Tube
Lack of enough sleep is a problem that affects about 35.2% of adults in the United States
("Short Sleep Duration"). This lack of sleep can be caused by many factors: stress, depression,
and insomnia, among many others. What can Americans do to combat these factors and get the
sleep they need? One way is to watch You Tube videos created by ASMRtists. These online
creators make ASMR videos: videos that feature quiet sounds, whispering, and soft visuals.
The purpose of these videos is to activate ASMR, a relatively unknown condition that
causes a warm tingling sensation in the head, neck, and shoulders when listening or viewing
certain "triggers." These triggers include soft whispering, tapping on objects, scratching different
materials, eating, personal attention, brushing hair, and hand movements. What triggers ASMR
varies widely between different people, so every video is made in different ways.
However, there are a few common factors in ASMR videos. The main component that
distinguishes them from other videos is the audio. ASMR videos only contain soft sounds.
Otherwise, they would defeat the purpose of triggering ASMR. They also feature soft visuals.
This means the background is dark and out-of-focus, while a soft light is cast on the ASMRtist's
face. This serves two purposes: it brings more attention to the creator and it also gives off the
impression of nighttime, when we are naturally sleepier.
Now, if you are new to ASMR, where do you start? That depends on whether you simply
want to watch and listen to ASMR or if you want to make it. If you want to watch ASMR videos,
simply going on You Tube and searching "ASMR" will yield thousands of results. However, if
you want to become an ASMRtist yourself, it requires a little more work.
The first thing needed is a camera and a computer. Otherwise, you would not be able to
record and edit videos. Any camera will do, however it is recommended that it can record in
1920 by 1080, which is the resolution of most screens. Next, you will need to decide which
microphone you will use. Since ASMR is a very audio-centric genre, this is a very important
decision.
When deciding what microphone to choose, there are three main setups that ASMRtists
usually use. The first is simply having one microphone in front of them. This is a very simple
setup that is easy to manage and edit with, but it deprives the creator of one major feature of
ASMR videos: ear-to-ear sounds. Without ear-to-ear sounds, the audio becomes simplistic,
which is often not well-received in the ASMR community.
The next setup is a little more complicated, but overall works very well for ear-to-ear
sounds. It entails buying two identical microphones and placing one on the left side of the video
and one on the right side of the video. This way, the ASMRtist can "move" sounds from the left
ear to the right ear, giving off the illusion that the audience is right there with them. This creates
a more personal feeling that a lot of ASMR viewers enjoy.
The last setup is a bit weirder and more expensive, but was created specifically for
making ASMR videos. Right now, there are two microphones that were made for ASMR videos:
the 3Dio FS Binaural line ("3Dio") and the wildly expensive Neumann KU 100 ("KU 100").
These microphones are protected by realistic rubber ears. This may sound odd, and even a little
creepy, but the reason for it is ingenious. By putting realistic ears around the actual microphones,
the sound waves bounce around in a similar fashion to how they would with a real ear. This
creates a more realistic sound that is often perfectly tuned to the range of real human ears.
Now that any potential ASMRtists have the necessary equipment, another major
challenge stands in their way: what type of video should they make? Despite what it may sound
like, there is actually quite a bit of diversity in the types of ASMR videos there are. There are
certain subgenres, like mukbang, roleplay videos, and hours long no talking videos, just to name
a few. As a quick overview, mukbang is Korean for "eating broadcast" (Zaman), where
ASMRtists eat food on camera. Roleplay videos entail the creator portraying a certain
profession, like a doctor, librarian, or hair stylists, in order to create a more one-on-one feel with
the audience. There are also ASMR videos that are hours long and do not contain any talking at
all, in what are simply known as "trigger videos."
This brings up another good question to ask yourself if making one of these videos: how
long do you make it? Typically ASMR videos are anywhere from about 10 minutes to multiple
hours long. This is simply due to the fact that it takes the average person 30 minutes to fall asleep
(Jones), and ASMRtists want people to fall asleep to their videos.
Now that you are ready to film your first ASMR video, one last thing stands in your way
that becomes obvious very quickly: almost every single ASMRtist is female (Allocca). This may
seem odd at first because ASMR is almost split evenly between men and women, but it skews
towards women slightly ("Polls about ASMR"). However, there is a growing number of male
ASMRtists that are challenging this traditionally female-dominated genre. One potential reason
for this discrepancy is the fact that many people see women as gentler and softer. According to
ASMRtist Maria Viktorovna, "women themselves are very nurturing creatures by nature, so we
see them as a softer, more caring gender" (Viktorovna).
Once you have your video all done, it's time to share it with the world! ASMR is most
prevalent on You Tube, so that should be your platform of choice. Once the video is published, it
often takes years to grow a decent following, so overnight success shouldn't be expected. In
order to grow your channel, consistency is key. Posting anywhere from once a month to multiple
times every day will slowly increase your following within the ASMR community. Hopefully
from there, you become the next big ASMRtist.
