Genre is seen as a means of communication for an author or a creator through any medium that can get across a specific message and achieve a goal. Certain genres differ depending on the "rules" that have been agreed on. "the difference is that the rules change as the genre changes, that no rules apply to all genres..." (Kerry Dirk) Common situations can be responded to with a common form of organized writing which is why genre is an important part of writing to this day. With the various amount of rhetorical stations, genre has grown into various categories as well as sub-categories. An example of this is the use of comic book covers. Although they aren't a genre that most people first think of, it contains all the right components to consider it a genre. Comic book covers utilized by comic artists share similar conventions and rhetoric that leads me to ask: why do artists create comic book covers? At first glance, the cover of a comic book seems to be only that, a cover. It may also seem to add an extra wow factor, but as I analyzed the similarities between covers, it appeared that there was indeed a goal the creators of these covers had in mind.
Audience and Purpose
All comic books are created with the intention of attracting the comic community and those who read comic books or are interested in reading comic books. Usually, comic books fluctuate with a specific target audience such as adults and children. Artists tend to use colors and graphics in their covers in order to appeal to a range of audiences. Soft graphics with light colors such as pink (Powerpuff girl) is used in order to appeal to children, specifically girls, whereas harsher lines and dark colors (Deadpool) are used for adults and/or boys. When the audience glances at the cover, they should be shown the title of the comic which alludes to the plot, the main character(s) of the comic, and at times speech from the characters in the form of text bubbles. Comics that are found in stores should also all include the price which they are being sold for, the company which is producing the comic, and the date it was published. All of the information which is contained on the covers of comic books should all be used in order to inform the audience of the main comic and also persuade them in purchasing it.
Rhetorical Strategies
As with most genres, comic books contain rhetorical salutations which provokes the artists to create a comic book cover. By understanding this, it is not possible to analyze the rhetorical strategy which is used to persuade the audience. Rhetorical strategies are any approach taken in order to persuade a targeted audience. A very prominent use in comic book specifically is the rhetorical triangle or ethos, pathos, and logos. Major companies such as marvel comics, dc comics, and dark horse comics brand their logo on comic books in order to grab the attention of readers who are a fan of their previous work. In order to provoke emotion in the audience, artists include the most intense scenes on the comic in order to build suspension. (batman).
Structure
With comic book covers specifically, all the information on it is structured in ways which make it possible for the comic artist to convey their message as wells as for their audience to obtain it. It is quite easy to tell the difference between a comic book cover and a textbook cover, and that is through the use of organization and design. A comic book cover is usually 6-5/8 inches wide by 10-1/4 inches high (formax printing) though there is no set exact dimension. Titles are more than often found on the upper middle portion of the page with large and form of Comic Sans font. The total design of the cover is meant to be a basis of the topic of the comic book. In a Fantastic Four Comic, the two main characters are shown on the middle of the cover with text bubbles foreshadowing a scene from the comic. (Fantastic Four). <name> <name> a first year art student at Cochise College, as well as a frequent comic book reader/artist said in an interview:
"Covers vary incredibly. Mainstream comics usually stay on a specific format for their covers because that's just what a always worked and what will continue to work. However, when you enter into the more alternative stories and the indie companies, cover design starts getting unique, so it really depends on what publisher you're analyzing. Mainstream covers are jampacked with characters, almost like a movie poster, while other covers display the characters in a more symbolic way such as a Dare Devil cover."
All the elements in the design and organization allow the readers to observe what is being provided on the front cover and predict the outcomes of the comic without even have read a single page.
