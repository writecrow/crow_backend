English 101
October 14, 2019
Genre is seen as a means of communication for an author or a creator through any medium that can get across a specific message and achieve a goal. Certain genres differ depending on the "rules" that have been agreed on. Common situations can be responded to with a common form of organized writing which is why genre is an important part of writing to this day. With the various amount of rhetorical stations, genre has grown into various categories as well as sub-categories. An example of this is the use of comic book covers. Though they aren't a genre that most people first think of, it contains all the right components to consider it a genre. Comic book covers utilized by comic artists share similar conventions and rhetoric that leads me to ask: why do artists create comic book covers?
At first glance, the cover of a comic book seems to be only that, a cover. It may also seem to add an extra wow factor, but as I analyzed the similarities between covers, it appeared that there was indeed a goal the creators of these covers had in mind. From the interview I conducted and from all the examples I analyzed, it led me to the idea that artists create comic book covers to attract their target audience and give an insight into the plot. All of this is achieved through its design layout, text, and visual aspects.
