ASMR Videos on You Tube
You may have been scrolling through your You Tube recommendations when you
stumble upon those four letters: ASMR. What does that mean? ASMR, which stands for
Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, is the tingling sensation that some people get in their
head, neck, and shoulders when listening to certain sounds or looking at certain visuals. The best
way it can be described is the feeling that you get when your foot falls asleep, but instead of
feeling like pins and needles, it feels like a warm massage.
The "triggers," as they are called, that typically cause ASMR include, but are not limited
to, soft whispering, ear-to-ear sounds, chewing gum, personal attention, flipping paper, tapping
and scratching certain objects or materials, brushing, and hand movements. Since ASMR is a
relaxing feeling, many people on the Internet create videos in order to intentionally cause
ASMR. These creators are known as ASMRtists.
Typically, people watch these videos in order to relax after a stressful day, help relieve
depression or anxiety, or fall asleep. With stress levels steadily rising in America (Ray), where
most You Tube viewers are (Migiro), it only makes sense that more and more people would want
to combat this stress with relaxing videos. As a result, the popularity of ASMR videos on
You Tube has skyrocketed.
Types of ASMR Videos
After viewing dozens of ASMR videos, I believe that they can be broken down into five
main categories: mukbang, roleplay, normal sounds, talking, and no talking. Mukbang, which
translates from Korean to "eating broadcast" (Zaman), is just that; eating food on camera to
trigger ASMR. This is appealing to some because of the mouth sounds created while eating.
Another type of ASMR video is roleplay, in which ASMRtists will pretend to be a certain
profession, such as a doctor or librarian. Some people like this because of the personal attention
aspect that goes along with it. Others like it simply because of the triggers in the video. For
example, a librarian roleplay video may contain typing sounds, paper flipping, and soft
whispering. Finally, normal sounds videos are just videos that contain regular ASMR sounds and
do not contain aspects of the other two categories. This usually involves the creator focusing on
certain triggers or types of objects, such as keyboards or wooden objects.
The next two categories are mutually exclusive; ASMR videos will either contain talking
or not. If they contain talking, it is almost always whispered from ear-to-ear. This goes hand in
hand with roleplay videos because the speaker can focus their attention on the audience to create
the aspect of personal attention. If no talking is present, then the creator can put the other sounds
and objects at the forefront of their video. As stated before, they may choose to only create
certain sounds and triggers, or they may have multiple sections planned out.
Common Features
ASMR is different for everybody. Some people enjoy certain sounds, whereas others will
despise them. In mukbang, for example, some people love eating and mouth sounds, but others
hate it. However, some triggers are almost universal in ASMR videos. Soft whispering is
extremely common because it gives off the feeling of a parental figure talking you to sleep or
reassuring you that everything is going to be fine. Ear-to-ear sounds are also common because it
allows the audience to immerse themselves into the scene created in the video.
These triggers often go along with personal attention. In a world that is increasingly busy,
there is very little time for people to focus on themselves. These videos give people the time they
need to focus on themselves. It also makes them feel like someone out there cares about them
and their wellbeing. Personal attention often entails the creator asking questions about the
audience or their day. These questions could be a part of roleplay, or they could be genuine
questions about the audience. For example, a doctor would ask you about your name, address, or
what symptoms you are experiencing. Other times, the speaker just wants to make sure you are
doing alright and assures you that there are people out there who care about them.
Another feature you may realize is that the lighting is often soft and neutral. Rarely will
you see an ASMR video that features bright neon lights. The soft light gives off the illusion of
dusk and nighttime. This will naturally make the audience unwind and feel sleepy.
Finally, ASMR videos are always devoid of harsh noises. Otherwise, they wouldn't be
ASMR videos. Since the purpose of ASMR is to relax the audience and help them fall asleep,
any loud noises would immediately negate this purpose. Rather, as stated before, ASMRtists
only use soft noises and whispering to activate ASMR. This is the main feature that differentiates
other You Tube videos from ASMR videos.
