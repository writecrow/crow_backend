As a business major, it seemed almost imperative to analyze a spreadsheet. Spreadsheets
are everywhere, whether organizing information on customers, payments, income, or whatever
else that needs to be organized in a grid-like system. And though it seems very specific,
spreadsheets can be used for almost anything. However, for this specific situation, the
spreadsheet being analyzed is one that organizes and tracks the revenue of the small business,
Dogtopia <place>
For context, Dogtopia <place> is a small dog daycare franchise owned by <name> <name>.
I interviewed her about the business, and she suggested that I analyze this kind of document
because it is "vital to anybody interested in pursuing business." Not formally trained herself, she
believes that it is important to be perceptive of every piece of information that is given. Even the
smallest details could have an incredibly strong impact going forward. And she also believes that
the best way to hold and organize these small bits of information is through a spreadsheet.
To begin, the revenue tracking spreadsheet is not meant to be readily available to the
entire franchise. If standard employees, customers, or the public had access to revenue records, it
could very easily influence the way the company is perceived, and how people treat it. For
example, if the employees see the company is failing, it is very possible they might leave and
turn their allegiances elsewhere in order to not be associated with a dying organization, much
less be unemployed if the business fails. On the other side, it could also be an incentive to take
advantage of the business. If the business is doing exceptionally well, the employees might feel
inclined to try to find ways to earn more money without working for it by clocking out late, or
some alternative method. Their excuse could consist of "the company won't notice," or "it's not
that big of an amount," which could cause major tensions. This being said, in most circumstances
the only ones to have access to this document are CFO's, general managers, and other major
officials. In Dogtopia's case, the only one with access to this document is Mrs. <name>, the
general manager. In addition, she is the only one with access to most records including money
because her position doubles as the financial officer. She tracks all of the information for herself,
to be able to see areas of weakness and strength within the business and to try to correct them. It
also can be compared to months past to see progress and understand how the business is
operating.
Spreadsheets tend to be very consistent in their layout, but yet still have a lot of
customization options. In most cases, Excel holds a large set of data in a table, easily navigated
by various headings which label the information in columns and rows. However, the various
customization options allow the owner of the document to color coordinate, easily shift the
information around, create charts, and various other ways of expressing the data at hand.
Specifically, Mrs. <name>, in the revenue tracking sheet, she has hundreds of separate
measures to count the data. She utilizes the spreadsheet's versatility to keep track of everything
that she might need for revenue. Revenue has so many different variables, especially for a dog
daycare business, that it seems the only way she could keep track of it is through a spreadsheet.
In the same document, she has to calculate daily gross revenue, sales quantity, referral
information, daycare pass statistics, month totals for all, projections, general information, and
weekly sales reports. But even with all of this information, the spreadsheet allows it all to be
easily accessible for quick analyzing and understanding of the data.
Spreadsheets tend to be formal documents, used in important situations where the data at
hand is very valuable. Business information, personal budgeting, list organizing, they all tend to
use spreadsheets to their advantage. However, a spreadsheet can be used for entirely informal
purposes if need be. It all comes down to the individual and what they need out of the document.
This being said, there is definitely not a lot of room to make the document informal, as there isn't
really any tone or anything to make it "official," it mainly comes down to the content that one is
organizing. If one is organizing business information like money, the spreadsheet tends to be
perceived as formal, but if one is using it for something like organizing character stats for
Dungeons and Dragons, then it would likely be perceived as informal.
One of the greatest tools a spreadsheet has to offer is that it can very easily convert
information to various different kinds of charts. This allows data to be displayed in many helpful
formats to help the reader understand the importance of the data and how it compares to itself. It
helps the reader visualize how significant changes in the data are, and trends over time. This can
be very useful because it shows the scale of decline in more of a way than a simple ratio. It helps
people who don't necessarily know what is going on within the spreadsheet to still read and
understand the information presented to them. In this situation, it allows a greater sized audience
to process the information, though in most business documents like stated before only a few have
access to this information. Charts help presentations as well because it becomes easier to openly
talk about and explain charts rather than a plethora of numbers that have minimal meaning to the
people reading it.
Overall, the spreadsheet genre is very wide; it allows for an infinite amount of
customizations, uses, and organizations for important or unimportant information. It allows the
writer to organize their information any way that they want, and keep it all centralized and easy
to access. It appeals to various different groups, mainly involving business, and is a universal
way to arrange data. It gives so many options, and thus there will always be a very efficient way
to store and assemble all of the data needed.
