ASMR Videos on You Tube
You may have been scrolling through your You Tube recommendations when you
stumble upon those four letters: ASMR. What does that mean? ASMR, which stands for
Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, is the tingling sensation that some people get in their
head, neck, and shoulders when listening to certain sounds or looking at certain visuals. The best
way it can be described is the feeling that you get when your foot falls asleep, but instead of
feeling like pins and needles, it feels like a warm massage.
The "triggers," as they are called, that typically cause ASMR include, but are not limited
to, soft whispering, ear-to-ear sounds, chewing gum, personal attention, flipping paper, tapping
and scratching certain objects or materials, brushing, and hand movements. Since ASMR is a
relaxing feeling, many people on the Internet create videos in order to intentionally cause
ASMR. These creators are known as ASMRtists.
Typically, people watch these videos in order to relax after a stressful day, help relieve
depression or anxiety, or fall asleep. With stress levels steadily rising in America (Ray), the
country with the most You Tube viewers (Migiro), it only makes sense that more and more
people would want to combat this stress with relaxing videos. As a result, the popularity of
ASMR videos on You Tube has skyrocketed (Mooney and Klein).
Types of ASMR Videos
After viewing dozens of ASMR videos, I believe that they can be broken down into five
main categories: mukbang, roleplay, normal sounds, talking, and no talking. Mukbang, which
translates from Korean to "eating broadcast" (Zaman), is just that: eating food on camera to
trigger ASMR. These videos are not restricted to one type of food. Rather, there is a whole range
of mukbang videos, from pickles to candy to noodles. This is appealing to some because of the
mouth sounds created while eating. Another type of ASMR video is roleplay, in which
ASMRtists will pretend to be a certain profession, such as a doctor or librarian, and act out a
scene with the audience. Some people like this because of the personal attention aspect that goes
along with it. Others like it simply because of the triggers in the video. For example, a librarian
roleplay video may contain typing sounds, paper flipping, and soft whispering. Finally, normal
sounds videos are just videos that contain regular ASMR sounds and do not contain aspects of
the other two categories. This usually involves the creator focusing on certain triggers or types of
objects, such as keyboards or wooden objects.
The next two categories are mutually exclusive: ASMR videos will either contain talking
or not. If they contain talking, it is almost always whispered from ear-to-ear, where ASMRtists
set up two microphones, each with audio going to either the left or right ear. This goes hand in
hand with roleplay videos because the speaker can shift their attention from one ear to the other
in order to give the effect of the audience being in the video. If no talking is present, then the
creator can put the other sounds and objects at the forefront of their video. As stated before, they
may choose to only create certain sounds and triggers, or they may have multiple sections
planned out.
Common Features of ASMR Videos
ASMR is different for everybody. Some people enjoy certain sounds, whereas others may
despise them. In mukbang, for example, some people love eating and mouth sounds, but others
hate it. However, some triggers are almost universal in ASMR videos. Soft whispering is
extremely common because it gives off the feeling of a parental figure talking you to sleep or
reassuring you that everything is going to be fine ("Meet The ASMR Creators"). Ear-to-ear
sounds are also common because it allows the audience to immerse themselves in the scene set
up in the video.
These ear-to-ear triggers often go along with personal attention. In a world that is
increasingly busy, there is very little time for people to focus on themselves. These videos give
people the time they need to focus on themselves. It also makes them feel like someone out there
cares about them and their wellbeing. Personal attention often entails the creator asking questions
about the audience or their day. Sometimes, commenters even answer these questions in the
comments section. These questions could be a part of roleplay, or they could be genuine
questions about the audience. For example, a doctor would ask you about your name, address, or
what symptoms you are experiencing. Other times, the speaker just wants to make sure you are
doing alright and assures you that there are people out there who care about them.
Another feature you may realize is that the lighting is often soft and neutral. Rarely will
you see an ASMR video that features bright neon lights. The soft light gives off the illusion of
dusk and nighttime. This will naturally make the audience unwind and feel sleepy.
An additional feature that differentiates ASMR videos from other You Tube videos is
their length. ASMR videos have a large range of running times; some of the shortest are about 10
minutes, but some of the longest can run for a few hours. This is because they are primarily
intended to help people fall asleep at night. Since it takes the average person about half an hour
to fall asleep (Jones), these videos must be that long if they want to achieve their purpose. If they
were any shorter than about 10 minutes, then almost nobody would be able to fall asleep to it.
However, there is no upper limit on how long they can or should be. This is because they are
intended to also help with, but not be a cure for, sleep insomnia. One ASMRtist points this out
by saying that "[her] video cannot replace any medication or professional treatment. If you have
sleep/anxiety/psychological troubles please consult your physician" (Viktorovna). If you do
experience any of these, ASMRtists often recommend you also seek professional help.
Finally, ASMR videos are always devoid of harsh noises. Otherwise, they wouldn't be
ASMR videos. Since the purpose of ASMR is to relax the audience and help them fall asleep,
any loud noises would immediately negate this purpose. Rather, as stated before, ASMRtists
only use soft noises and whispering to activate ASMR. This is the main feature that differentiates
other You Tube videos from ASMR videos. While this may sound overly simplistic, Kerri Dirk
says that "actions don't have to be complex; many genres are part of our daily lives" (252). So, if
you simply use ASMR to fall asleep every night, then it is fulfilling its purpose.
Conclusion
ASMR videos are created by ASMRtists in order to help their viewers relax or fall asleep.
This genre came about after people who experience ASMR found each other on Internet forums
(Keiles). After discussing what causes ASMR, they wanted to find a way to activate it
intentionally.
What makes these videos different from regular You Tube videos is the fact that they are
not meant to captivate the audience, but rather relax them. They accomplish this goal by filming
"triggers" of ASMR. This includes soft whispering, eating, tapping, and flipping paper. These
triggers are different for everybody. So, ASMRtists will often make videos of just one kind of
ASMR. For example, they may focus on mukbang, or eating videos, roleplay videos, or videos
without any talking.
Some common features that identify an ASMR video include these triggers, the lack of
harsh noises, soft lights, and a long runtime. The triggers and lack of harsh noises are simply to
cause ASMR in those who experience it. The soft lights are used to create the illusion of a dark
and comforting place where the audience can easily relax. Finally, the long runtimes, sometimes
upwards of a few hours, is meant to help their audience fall asleep or reduce the symptoms of
sleep insomnia.
If you are interested in ASMR, or are having trouble falling asleep, I would highly
recommend giving ASMR videos a try. It has helped me, and millions of others, relax when our
lives got stressful. While they are not a replacement for medication or professional treatment,
they can help improve your mood and alleviate chronic pain (Barratt and Davis). If it helps you
in any way, I sincerely hope that you make it a part of your nightly routine.
