Genre and Discourse Analysis
University of Arizona
October 25, 2019
MIS (Management of Information Systems) classes. Dr. <name> has only been teaching here at
the university for six going on seven years. While his short career here as a teacher so far has
propelled him to the director of BS/MIS that does not make him any less qualified. Dr. <name>
graduated from the University of Memphis as an undergraduate student, and then from Arizona
State University with a Ph D. in computer science. Since then he has been working as an engineer
with companies such as Honeywell, Inter-tel, and Global Atmospherics. One interesting topic
that Dr. <name> shared with me was that at Arizona State University the Management of
Information Securities, is called Computer Information Systems (CIS). This is due to the fact that
at Arizona State University the focus isn't on management systems like it is here at the
University of Arizona, instead it is the focus of computers themselves. Dr. <name> <name> has
different backgrounds in many fields, but that does not change the fact that he has changed the
way this course is being taught here at Arizona, and has peaked my interest into further studies.	Dr. <name> has had a variety of different experiences in his lines of work in the past.
As I described earlier, he was not always a professor, he was instead an engineer and had
different responsibilities. For instance, as an engineer he would write code, reports, and
instructions for what the project at the time was. In this line of work he made it clear that no
matter whom he is writing to you need to know your audience. He made this an integral part of
the whole interview. If you were not to know your audience then we would have a hard time
knowing who to speak to, how to adjust what we are saying to them, and even risking the event
of confusion in the workplace. As a professor Dr. <name> has a plethora in writing styles he
uses. He also has to write to many different audiences, from students, to his peers and colleagues.
In fact Dr. <name> said there were three main parts to the writing he uses here. The first one is
ironic, it is knowing your audience, that is one of the main focuses in this english class. If we
know the audience then we know how to market towards them. The second is to be clear and
concise not blowing it up to be more than it is but to communicate it in a way that is efficient.
The last and final is a mixture of both but he states it in a way that makes it the most vital, and it is just pure communication. Nothing else would stand if it wasn't for this one rule. It would come
across wrong and wrong.
I have had the opportunity to be in Dr. <name> class this semester and so far in his
class I have been introduced to ways of writing and even a new learning technique I didn't even
know about. In his class we have been doing projects called APB's or applied business projects.
This was the example that Dr. <name> provided to me himself. In the outline itself it is targeted
to students in his MIS class and students of all grades in that class. This outline is to show the
breakdown of the project itself. Showing what the tasks are and how to understand them, it walks
us through them one at a time. I use these on a weekly basis due to the many projects we have,
and so far I have tried my best to follow them word for word. The length of the document is six
to seven pages all instructional. The language is instructional and formal no casual language.
There does happen to be many visuals and diagrams to show what the graphs and modules are.
These are great instructions and parameters. Like any normal instructional message there are
fonts that show what to do and what it should look like. There does happen to ve visuals such as
text wrapped in bold to show the significance of the text and what it contains. The citations in
this paper is unusual , the citations we use for the data we put right under the graph or paragraph
we write. We typically to not have citations at the end of the paper. Instead the citations are
instant and shows the exact information we used in that moment. In this course and this job
specifically there are a lot of acronyms such as MIS, APB, ICQ, PAR, and more that are vital to
understanding this course and the writing that Dr. <name> provides in this course. In this kind
of writing in particular, as I expressed earlier, the writing is formal and informative, there isn't
much jargon or informal writing.
Interviewing Dr. <name> was an enlightening experience and to see the writing that is
used everyday I did not even think about. The types of writing that Dr. <name> uses comes
from many different backgrounds that not many other people have, such as his experience in
engineering, management, and as a graduate student. Dr. <name> was engulfed in many
different kinds of literature. I like Dr. <name> writing style because it is something even baby
freshman can understand. I have had some trouble in this course but I can guarantee that it is not
because of any miscommunication from the professors. Unlike many other of the interviewees
that my peers have chosen their writing sample seems to be articles or excerpts from a book,
mine happens to be an instructional and informative. All in all, I did enjoy learning all I did from
Dr. <name> I believe it opened me up to a new world that I didn't know about, the writing of a
field that is not depended on writing. I would be interested to learn more about what this field,
and others with the same focus in business are like in terms of writing. This is only my freshman
year and as I engulfed myself more into the ideas of business and their aspects then I believe I
will gain a new understanding of the bones that make this major and field so successful. This is
all thanks to Dr. <name> <name>
